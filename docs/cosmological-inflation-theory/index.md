# Cosmological inflation theory


- In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early [universe](docs/universe/index/). 
- The inflationary epoch is believed to have lasted from 10−36 seconds after the conjectured [Big Bang](docs/big-bang/index/) [singularity](docs/singularity/index/) to some time between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the singularity. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The acceleration of this expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago).[1]

- Most of what we know, or believe we know, about the early moments of the universe is thanks to an idea called *inflation theory* first propounded in 1979 by a junior particle physicist, then at Stanford, now at MIT, named Alan Guth. (Location 262)
- The eventual result was the *inflation theory*, which holds that a fraction of a moment after the dawn of creation, the universe underwent a sudden dramatic expansion. It inflated—in effect ran away with itself, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds. (Location 266)
