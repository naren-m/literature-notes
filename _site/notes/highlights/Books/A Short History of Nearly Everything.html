<ul>
  <li>In fact, you will need to gather up everything there is—every last mote and particle of matter between here and the edge of creation—and squeeze it into a spot so infinitesimally compact that it has no dimensions at all. It is known as a [[singularity]]. (Location 193)</li>
  <li>Most of what we know, or believe we know, about the early moments of the [[universe]] is thanks to an idea called [[Cosmological inflation theory]] first propounded in 1979 by a junior particle physicist, then at Stanford, now at MIT, named Alan Guth. (Location 262)</li>
  <li>
    <p>The eventual result was the [[Cosmological inflation theory]], which holds that a fraction of a moment after the dawn of creation, the [[universe]] underwent a sudden dramatic expansion. It inflated—in effect ran away with itself, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds. (Location 266)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason that some experts believe there may have been many other [[big bang]]s, perhaps trillions and trillions of them, spread through the mighty span of eternity, and that the reason we exist in this particular one is that this is one we could exist in. As Edward P. Tryon of Columbia University once put it: “In answer to the question of why it happened, I offer the modest proposal that our [[Universe]] is simply one of those things which happen from time to time.” To which adds Guth: “Although the creation of a [[universe]] might be very unlikely, Tryon emphasized that no one had counted the failed attempts.” (Location 284)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rees maintains that six numbers in particular govern our [[universe]], and that if any of these values were changed even very slightly things could not be as they are. For example, for the [[universe]] to exist as it does requires that hydrogen be converted to helium in a precise but comparatively stately manner—specifically, in a way that converts seven one-thousandths of its mass to energy. Lower that value very slightly—from 0.007 percent to 0.006 percent, say—and no transformation could take place: the [[universe]] would consist of hydrogen and nothing else. Raise the value very slightly—to 0.008 percent—and bonding would be so wildly prolific that the hydrogen would long since have been exhausted. In either case, with the slightest tweaking of the numbers the [[universe]] as we know and need it would not be here. (Location 293)</p>
  </li>
  <li>I should say that everything is just right so far.
    <ul>
      <li>In the long term, [[gravity]] may turn out to be a little too strong, and one day it may halt the expansion of the [[universe]] and bring it collapsing in upon itself, till it crushes itself down into another [[singularity]], possibly to start the whole process over again.</li>
      <li>On the other hand it may be too weak and the [[universe]] will keep racing away forever until everything is so far apart that there is no chance of material interactions, so that the [[universe]] becomes a place that is inert and dead, but very roomy.</li>
      <li>The third option is that [[gravity]] is just right—“[[critical density]]” is the cosmologists’ term for it—and that it will hold the [[universe]] together at just the right dimensions to allow things to go on indefinitely. (Location 299)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and one day it may halt the expansion of the [[universe]] and bring it collapsing in upon itself, till it crushes (Location 300)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cosmologists in their lighter moments sometimes call this the Goldilocks effect—that everything is just right. (For the record, these three possible [[universe]]s are known respectively as closed, open, and flat.) (Location 304)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what would happen if you traveled out to the edge of the [[universe]] and, as it were, put your head through the curtains? Where would your head be if it were no longer in the [[universe]]? What would you find beyond? The answer, disappointingly, is that you can never get to the edge of the [[universe]]. That’s not because it would take too long to get there—though of course it would—but because even if you traveled outward and outward in a straight line, indefinitely and pugnaciously, you would never arrive at an outer boundary. Instead, you would come back to where you began (at which point, presumably, you would rather lose heart in the exercise and give up). The reason for this is that the [[universe]] bends, in a way we can’t adequately imagine, in conformance with Einstein’s theory of relativity (which we will get to in due course). For the moment it is enough to know that we are not adrift in some large, ever-expanding bubble. Rather, space curves, in a way that allows it to be boundless but finite. (Location 306)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or as the biologist J. B. S. Haldane once famously observed: “The [[universe]] is not only queerer than we suppose; it is queerer than we can suppose.” (Location 315)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>point—to forge these heavy elements, you need the kind of heat and energy of a [[Big Bang]]. Yet there has been only one [[Big Bang]] and it didn’t produce them. So where did they come from? Interestingly, the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who heartily despised the [[Big Bang]] as a theory and coined the term “[[Big Bang]]” sarcastically, as a way of mocking it. (Location 333)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the Voyager craft were launched when they were (in August and September 1977) was that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were aligned in a way that happens only once every 175 years. This enabled the two Voyagers to use a “[[gravity]] assist” technique in which the craft were successively flung from one gassy giant to the next in a kind of cosmic version of “crack the whip.” (Location 409)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We won’t get to the solar system’s edge until we have passed through the Oort cloud, a vast celestial realm of drifting comets, and we won’t reach the Oort cloud for another—I’m so sorry about this—ten thousand years. (Location 437)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pluto is barely one-fifty-thousandth of the way. (Location 439)</p>
  </li>
  <li>As it is, even with the Hubble telescope, we can’t see even into the Oort cloud, so we don’t actually know that it is there. Its existence is probable but entirely hypothetical.*2 (Location 444)</li>
  <li>The basic unit of measure in the solar system is the Astronomical Unit, or AU, representing the distance from the Sun to the Earth. Pluto is about forty AUs from us, the heart of the Oort cloud about fifty thousand. (Location 448)</li>
  <li>Our nearest neighbor in the cosmos, Proxima Centauri, which is part of the three-star cluster known as Alpha Centauri, is 4.3 light-years away, a sissy skip in galactic terms, but that is still a hundred million times farther than a trip to the Moon. To reach it by spaceship would take at least twenty-five thousand years, (Location 462)</li>
  <li>The average distance between stars out there is 20 million million miles. (Location 467)</li>
  <li>Nobody knows how many stars there are in the Milky Way—estimates range from 100 billion or so to perhaps 400 billion—and the Milky Way is just one of 140 billion or so other galaxies, many of them even larger than ours. (Location 471)</li>
  <li>In the 1960s, a professor at Cornell named Frank Drake, excited by such whopping numbers, worked out a famous equation designed to calculate the chances of advanced life in the cosmos based on a series of diminishing probabilities. Under Drake’s equation you divide the number of stars in a selected portion of the [[universe]] by the number of stars that are likely to have planetary systems; divide that by the number of planetary systems that could theoretically support life; divide that by the number on which life, having arisen, advances to a state of intelligence; and so on. At each such division, the number shrinks colossally—yet even with the most conservative inputs the number of advanced civilizations just in the Milky Way always works out to be somewhere in the millions. (Location 473)</li>
  <li>[[Supernova]]e occur when a giant star, one much bigger than our own Sun, collapses and then spectacularly explodes, releasing in an instant the energy of a hundred billion suns, burning for a time brighter than all the stars in its galaxy. (Location 502)</li>
  <li>The term [[supernova]] was coined in the 1930s by a memorably odd astrophysicist named Fritz Zwicky. Born in Bulgaria and raised in Switzerland, (Location 527)</li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early 1930s, he turned his attention to a question that had long troubled astronomers: the appearance in the sky of occasional unexplained points of light, new stars. Improbably he wondered if the [[neutron]]—the subatomic particle that had just been discovered in England by James Chadwick, and was thus both novel and rather fashionable—might be at the heart of things. It occurred to him that if a star collapsed to the sort of densities found in the core of atoms, the result would be an unimaginably compacted core. Atoms would literally be crushed together, their [[electron]]s forced into the nucleus, forming [[neutron]]s. You would have a [[neutron star]]. (Location 534)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The core of a [[neutron star]] is so dense that a single spoonful of matter from it would weigh 200 billion pounds. A spoonful! But there was more. Zwicky realized that after the collapse of such a star there would be a huge amount of energy left over—enough to make the biggest bang in the [[universe]]. He called these resultant explosions [[supernova]]e. (Location 540)</li>
