# Vaiseshika Darshanam

Vaiseshika (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six orthodox philosophical schools (Shad-Darshana) of Hindu philosophy, representing one of the world's earliest systematic approaches to naturalistic and atomistic thinking. Founded by the sage Kanada (also known as Kashyapa or Kana-bhuj, meaning "atom-eater") around 6th-2nd century BCE.

## Etymology and Meaning

- **Vaiseshika**: Derived from "vishesha" (विशेष) meaning "particularity" or "distinguishing characteristic"
- **Focus**: The school emphasizes the analysis of particular qualities that distinguish one thing from another
- **Alternative Names**: Aulukya (from Uluka, another name for Kanada), Kanada Darshanam

## Foundational Text: [[VaishshikaSutra]]

### Structure
The Vaiseshika Sutra consists of:
- **10 Adhyayas (Chapters)**
- **Approximately 373 Sutras**
- **Systematic categorization** of all existence

### Key Opening Sutra
अथातो धर्मं व्याख्यास्यामः (1.1.1)
*"Now we shall explain dharma (righteousness/natural law)"*

धर्माद् अभ्युदयनिःश्रेयससिद्धिः (1.1.2)
*"From dharma comes prosperity (abhyudaya) and the highest good (nihshreyasa)"*

## Fundamental Categories (Padarthas)

Vaiseshika philosophy organizes all existence into seven fundamental categories:

### 1. Dravya (Substance)
The substrate in which qualities inhere and actions occur. Nine types:

#### Physical Substances (Bhautika Dravya)
1. **Prithvi (Earth)** - Solid matter with smell as characteristic quality
2. **Ap (Water)** - Liquid matter with taste as characteristic quality  
3. **Tejas (Fire)** - Energy/heat with form/color as characteristic quality
4. **Vayu (Air)** - Gaseous matter with touch as characteristic quality

#### Non-Physical Substances
5. **Akasha (Space/Ether)** - All-pervading medium with sound as characteristic quality
6. **Kala (Time)** - Temporal framework for all changes and sequences
7. **Dik (Direction)** - Spatial framework providing orientation and position
8. **Atman (Soul)** - Conscious entity, the seat of knowledge and experience
9. **Manas (Mind)** - Internal instrument of perception and cognition

### 2. Guna (Quality/Attribute)
Properties that inhere in substances but cannot exist independently. Twenty-four types:

#### Sensory Qualities
1. **Rupa (Form/Color)** - Visual quality
2. **Rasa (Taste)** - Gustatory quality  
3. **Gandha (Smell)** - Olfactory quality
4. **Sparsha (Touch)** - Tactile quality
5. **Shabda (Sound)** - Auditory quality

#### Physical Qualities
6. **Sankhya (Number)** - Numerical quantity
7. **Parimana (Magnitude)** - Size and dimension
8. **Prithaktva (Separateness)** - Discreteness
9. **Samyoga (Conjunction)** - Connection
10. **Vibhaga (Disjunction)** - Separation
11. **Paratva (Remoteness)** - Distance in space/time
12. **Aparatva (Nearness)** - Proximity in space/time
13. **Gurutva (Weight/Heaviness)** - Gravitational property
14. **Dravatva (Fluidity)** - Liquid state property
15. **Sneha (Viscosity)** - Cohesive property

#### Mental/Cognitive Qualities
16. **Buddhi (Cognition)** - Knowledge and understanding
17. **Sukha (Pleasure)** - Pleasant experience
18. **Duhkha (Pain)** - Unpleasant experience
19. **Iccha (Desire)** - Volition and wanting
20. **Dvesha (Aversion)** - Repulsion and dislike
21. **Prayatna (Effort)** - Conscious exertion

#### Temporal Qualities
22. **Dharma (Merit)** - Positive karmic quality
23. **Adharma (Demerit)** - Negative karmic quality
24. **Samskara (Tendency)** - Latent impressions and dispositions

### 3. Karma (Action/Motion)
Dynamic aspects of reality. Five types:
1. **Utkshepana (Upward motion)** - Rising movement
2. **Avakshepana (Downward motion)** - Falling movement  
3. **Akunchana (Contraction)** - Inward movement
4. **Prasarana (Expansion)** - Outward movement
5. **Gamana (General locomotion)** - Translational movement

### 4. Samanya (Universals/Generality)
Common properties that allow classification:
- **Para Samanya**: Highest universal (Being/Existence)
- **Apara Samanya**: Lower universals (Cowness, Potness, etc.)
- **Samanyavishesha**: Intermediate universals

### 5. Vishesha (Particularity)
Ultimate differentiating factors:
- Present in eternal substances (atoms, souls, minds, time, space, direction)
- Provide individual identity to otherwise similar entities
- Account for numerical difference among indistinguishable objects

### 6. Samavaya (Inherence)
Eternal, invariable relationship between:
- Substance and quality
- Substance and action
- Whole and parts
- Universal and particular
- Distinguishes from mere conjunction (samyoga)

### 7. Abhava (Non-existence/Absence)
(Added by later Vaiseshika philosophers)
Four types:
1. **Pragabhava**: Prior non-existence (before creation)
2. **Dhvamsabhava**: Posterior non-existence (after destruction)
3. **Atyantabhava**: Absolute non-existence (never exists)
4. **Anyonyabhava**: Mutual non-existence (A is not B)

## Atomic Theory (Paramanu Vada)

### Revolutionary Concept
Vaiseshika presents one of the world's earliest systematic atomic theories, predating Greek atomism.

#### Atomic Characteristics
- **Paramanu** (परमाणु): Ultimate indivisible particles
- **Eternal and indestructible**: Cannot be created or destroyed
- **Infinitesimal size**: Beyond sensory perception
- **Qualitative difference**: Earth, water, fire, and air atoms have distinct properties
- **Partless**: No internal division or structure

#### Molecular Formation (Tryanuka)
1. **Dyad (Dyanuka)**: Two atoms combine
2. **Triad (Tryanuka)**: Three atoms or one atom + one dyad
3. **Gross objects**: Built from increasingly complex combinations
4. **Minimum perceptible**: Tryanuka is smallest visible unit

### Cosmic Cycles

#### Creation (Srishti)
1. **Divine will** (Adrishta) initiates atomic motion
2. **Binary combinations** form from atomic attractions
3. **Progressive aggregation** creates gross matter
4. **Cosmic bodies** form through continued combination

#### Destruction (Pralaya)
1. **Dissolution process** reverses creation
2. **Gross objects** break down to atomic level
3. **Atoms remain** eternal and unchanged
4. **Potential for recreation** always present

## Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)

### Pramanas (Valid Means of Knowledge)

#### 1. Pratyaksha (Perception)
- **Direct sensory experience** through five sense organs
- **Extraordinary perception**: Yogic and divine perception
- **Contact requirement**: Sense-object contact necessary
- **Immediate knowledge**: Direct and non-inferential

#### 2. Anumana (Inference)
- **Logical reasoning** from observed to unobserved
- **Three-term structure**: Minor term, major term, middle term
- **Five-member syllogism**: Statement, reason, example, application, conclusion
- **Universal concomitance**: Invariable connection between reason and conclusion

### Knowledge Process
1. **Manas (Mind)** as internal instrument
2. **Atman (Soul)** as conscious substrate
3. **Sense organs** as external instruments
4. **Object contact** initiates knowledge process
5. **Buddhi (Cognition)** as resulting awareness

## Ethics and Liberation

### Moral Framework

#### Dharma and Adharma
- **Invisible forces** (Adrishta) governing moral consequences
- **Causal efficacy** in producing results
- **Karmic inheritance** in soul through multiple lives
- **Natural law** rather than divine command

#### Path to Liberation
1. **True knowledge** of categories (Padarthas)
2. **Discrimination** between self and non-self
3. **Detachment** from worldly objects
4. **Cessation of activity** leading to bondage
5. **Final liberation** (Moksha) as complete cessation of suffering

### Liberation Characteristics
- **Absolute cessation** of pain and pleasure
- **No positive bliss** (unlike other schools)
- **Individual liberation** for each soul
- **Eternal state** once achieved
- **Knowledge-based** rather than devotional

## Relationship with [[NyayaSutra]]

### Historical Association
- **Complementary systems**: Nyaya provides logic, Vaiseshika provides metaphysics
- **Shared epistemology**: Both accept same pramanas
- **Common goal**: Liberation through right knowledge
- **Later synthesis**: Combined into Nyaya-Vaiseshika school

### Differences
- **Primary focus**: Nyaya emphasizes logic, Vaiseshika emphasizes categories
- **Atomism**: Unique to Vaiseshika
- **Systematic categorization**: More developed in Vaiseshika
- **Practical reasoning**: More emphasized in Nyaya
