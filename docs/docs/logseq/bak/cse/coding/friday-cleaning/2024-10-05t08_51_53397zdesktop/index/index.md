# Friday cleaning

Idea is to put conscious effort to [Maintaining code base](cse/coding/maintaining-code-base/) making small incremental
quantifiable changes to the code base.

- Pick one small piece of code that you can make better in couple of hours
- Make a "how to use" article/wiki.
- Add unit test to existing code. Try and increase coverage by [One percent rule](logseq/bak/one-percent-rule/2025-06-25t18_36_37315zdesktop/)
- Add automation for an existing uncovered use case.
