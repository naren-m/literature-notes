<ul>
  <li>Whatever sphere of the human mind may be selected for special study, whether language, religion, mythology, or philosophy, whether laws, customs, primitive art or primitive science, we must go to India, because some of the most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up there, and there only. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=107">Location 107</a>)</li>
  <li>He who knows little of those who preceded is very likely to care little for those coming after. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=115">Location 115</a>)</li>
  <li>The literature of the world in all ages has been richly furnished, if not actually inspired, from that fountain. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=120">Location 120</a>)</li>
  <li>One of the most beautiful poems in the German language is the Weisheit der Brahmanen, the “Wisdom of the Brahmans,” by Rückert, to my mind more rich in thought and more perfect in form than even Goethe’s West-östlicher Divan. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=188">Location 188</a>)</li>
  <li>“What can India teach us?” True, there are many things which India has to learn from us; but there are other things, and, in one sense, very important things, which we too may learn from India. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=215">Location 215</a>)</li>
  <li>If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power, and beauty that nature can bestow—in some parts a very paradise on earth—I should point to India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most full developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant—I should point to India. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=217">Location 217</a>)</li>
  <li>Think, for instance, of the allusion to the fable of the donkey in the lion’s skin, which occurs in Plato’s Cratylus.5 Was that borrowed from the East? Or take the fable of the weasel changed by Aphroditê into a woman who, when she saw a mouse, could not refrain from making a spring at it. This, too, is very like a Sanskrit fable; but how then could it have been brought into Greece early enough to appear in one of the comedies of Strattis, about 400 B.C.?6 Here, too, there is still plenty of work to do. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=263">Location 263</a>)</li>
  <li>That at the time of Solomon there was a channel of communication open between India and Syria and Palestine is established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit words which occur in the Bible as names of articles of export from Ophir, articles such as ivory, apes, peacocks, and sandalwood, which, taken together, could not have been exported from any country but India.7 Nor is there any reason to suppose that the commercial intercourse between India, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean was ever completely interrupted, even at the time when the Book of Kings is supposed to have been written. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=269">Location 269</a>)</li>
  <li>Now you remember the judgment of Solomon, which has always been admired as a proof of great legal wisdom among the Jews.8 I must confess that, not having a legal mind, I never could suppress a certain shudder9 when reading the decision of Solomon: “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=274">Location 274</a>)</li>
  <li>two women who claimed each to be the mother of the same child. The king, after listening to their quarrels for a long time, gave it up as hopeless to settle who was the real mother. Upon this Visâkhâ stepped forward and said: “What is the use of examining and cross-examining these women? Let them take the boy and settle it among themselves.” Thereupon both women fell on the child, and when the fight became violent the child was hurt and began to cry. Then one of them let him go, because she could not bear to hear the child cry. That settled the question. The king gave the child to the true mother, and had the other beaten with a rod. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=279">Location 279</a>)</li>
  <li>New materials are being discovered every year, as, for instance, the so-called Dharma or Samayâkârika Sûtras, which have supplied the materials for the later metrical law-books, such as the famous Laws of Manu. What was once called “The Code of Laws of Manu,” and confidently referred to 1200, or at least 500 B.C., (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=294">Location 294</a>)</li>
  <li>And in that study of the history of the human mind, in that study of ourselves, of our true selves, India occupies a place second to no other country. Whatever sphere of the human mind you may select for your special study, whether it be language, or religion, or mythology, or philosophy, whether it be laws or customs, primitive art or primitive science, everywhere, you have to go to India, whether you like it or not, because some of the most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India, and in India only. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B09R4TBJ5S&amp;location=326">Location 326</a>)</li>
  <li>And while thus trying to explain to those whose lot will soon be cast in India the true position which that wonderful country holds or ought to hold in universal history, I may perhaps be able at the same time to appeal to the sympathies of other members of this University, by showing them how imperfect our knowledge of universal history, our insight into the development of the human intellect, must always remain, if we narrow our horizon to the history of Greeks and Romans, Saxons and Celts, with a dim background of Palestine, Egypt, and Babylon,12 and leave out of sight our nearest intellectual relatives, the Aryans of India, the framers of the most wonderful language, the Sanskrit, the fellow-workers in the construction of our fundamental concepts, the fathers of the most natural of natural religions, the makers of the most transparent of mythologies, the inventors of the most subtle philosophy, and the givers of the most elaborate laws.
