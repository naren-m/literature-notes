# CIA Triad

CIA Triad is a reference to [confidentiality](cse/cryptography/confidentiality/), [integrity](cse/cryptography/integrity/), and [availability](cse/cryptography/availability/), which are the pillars of security. 


Each is a category of security:

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the heart of cryptography, which is protecting sensitive data.
Applying encryption to data provides confidentiality.

## Integrity

Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.

[Hashing](cse/cryptography/hashing/) algorithms are used to confirm integrity.

## Availability

Availability means resources and services are available as expected.

Digital signatures, a combination of [Hashing](cse/cryptography/hashing/) and [Encryption](cse/cryptography/encryption/), can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
