<h3 id="the-aggregation-of-marginal-gains">“the aggregation of marginal gains,”</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. (Location 232)

      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Aggregational marginal change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="divide-and-improve">Divide and improve</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” (Location 235)
