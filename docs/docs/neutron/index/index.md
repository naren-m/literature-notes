# neutron

Improbably he wondered if the [neutron](neutron/)—the subatomic particle that had just been discovered in England by James Chadwick, and was thus both novel and rather fashionable—might be at the heart of things. It occurred to him that if a star collapsed to the sort of densities found in the core of atoms, the result would be an unimaginably compacted core. Atoms would literally be crushed together, their electrons forced into the nucleus, forming [neutron](neutron/)s. You would have a [neutron star](neutron-star/). (Location 534)
