# Initialization Vector

An initialization vector (IV) adds another ingredient to the asymmetric [encryption](docs/cse/cryptography/encryption/index/) algorithm, which makes the digest less predictable. Adversaries can use predictability to glean information from patterns and exploit [security vulnerabilities](docs/security/security-vulnerabilities/index/). For that reason, an IV makes [encryption](docs/cse/cryptography/encryption/index/) more secure.
