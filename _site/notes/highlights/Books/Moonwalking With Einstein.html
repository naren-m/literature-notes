  <li>Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives. (Location 1077)</li>
  <li>William James first wrote about the curious warping and foreshortening of psychological time in his Principles of Psychology in 1890: “In (Location 1078)</li>
  <li>Socrates thought the unexamined life was not worth living. (Location 1090)</li>
  <li>Though there is disagreement about just how many memory systems there are, scientists generally divide memories broadly into two types: declarative and nondeclarative (sometimes referred to as explicit and implicit). (Location 1128)</li>
  <li>Motor skill learning takes place largely in the cerebellum, perceptual learning in the neocortex, habit learning in the basal ganglia. (Location 1134)</li>
  <li>Indeed, most of who we are and how we think—the core material of our personalities—is bound up in implicit memories that are off-limits to the conscious brain. (Location 1135)</li>
  <li>declarative memories, psychologists make a further distinction between semantic memories, or memories for facts and concepts, and episodic memories, or memories of the experiences of our own lives. (Location 1137)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Semantic memories for fcts
Episodic memory for experiences</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Semantic memories are located outside of time (Location 1140)</li>
  <li>both are critically dependent on the hippocampus and other structures within the medial temporal lobes. (Location 1142)</li>
  <li>For some unknown reason, it’s the most recent memories that blur first in most amnesics, while distant memories retain their clarity. This phenomenon is known as Ribot’s Law, (Location 1145)</li>
  <li>that our memories are not static. (Location 1147)</li>
  <li>Each time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our web of other memories, and therefore make it more stable and less likely to be dislodged. (Location 1148)</li>
  <li>transform the memory, and reshape it—sometimes to the point that our memories of events bear only a passing resemblance to what actually happened. (Location 1149)</li>
  <li>Sigmund Freud first noted the curious fact that older memories are often remembered as if captured by a third person holding a camera, whereas more recent events tend to be remembered in the first person, as if through one’s own eyes. (Location 1152)</li>
  <li>over time, the brain naturally turns episodes into facts. (Location 1154)</li>
  <li>well-supported hypothesis holds that our memories are nomadic. (Location 1155)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Memories fre not static

Over time experiences trns formm into facts

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>hippocampus is involved in their initial formation, their contents are ultimately held in long-term storage in the neocortex. (Location 1156)</li>
  <li>neocortex is not fully developed until about the third or fourth year, (Location 1179)</li>
  <li>most basic principle of all mnemonics: “elaborative encoding.” (Location 1234)</li>
  <li>Most of the evolution that shaped the primitive brains of our prehuman ancestors into the linguistic, symbolic, neurotic modern brains that serve us (sometimes poorly) today took place during the Pleistocene, an epoch which began about 1.8 million years ago and only ended ten thousand years ago. (Location 1237)</li>
  <li>The principle underlying all memory techniques is that our brains don’t remember all types of information equally well. (Location 1248)</li>
  <li>“The general idea with most memory techniques is to change whatever boring thing is being inputted into your memory into something that is so colorful, so exciting, and so different from anything you’ve seen before that you can’t possibly forget it,” (Location 1252)</li>
  <li>“proud tradition of mnemonists.” That proud tradition began, at least according to legend, in the fifth century B.C. with the poet Simonides of Ceos standing in the rubble of the great banquet hall collapse in Thessaly. (Location 1284)</li>
  <li>Simonides reputedly invented a technique that would form the basis of what came to be known as the art of memory. (Location 1288)</li>
  <li>training—indeed, nearly all the memory tricks in the mental athlete’s arsenal—were first described in a short, anonymously authored Latin rhetoric textbook called the Rhetorica ad Herennium, written sometime between 86 and 82 B.C. (Location 1295)</li>
  <li>the basic techniques have remained fundamentally unchanged from those described in the Ad Herennium. “This book is our bible,” Ed told me. (Location 1298)</li>
  <li>investigation with the classics. In addition to the Ad Herennium, there would be translated excerpts of Quintilian’s Institutio Oratoria and Cicero’s De Oratore for me to read, followed by a collection of medieval writings on memory by Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Hugh of St. Victor, and Peter of Ravenna. (Location 1302)</li>
  <li>“Ancient and medieval people reserved their awe for memory. Their greatest geniuses they describe as people of superior memories,” (Location 1318)</li>
  <li>“The natural memory is that memory which is embedded in our minds, born simultaneously with thought. The artificial memory is that memory which is strengthened by a kind of training and system of discipline.” (Location 1323)</li>
  <li>natural memory is the hardware you’re born with. Artificial memory is the software you run on your hardware. (Location 1324)</li>
  <li>Artificial memory, the anonymous author continues, has two basic components: images and places. Images represent the contents of what one wishes to remember. Places—or loci, as they’re called in the original Latin—are where those images are stored. (Location 1325)</li>
  <li>The idea is to create a space in the mind’s eye, a place that you know well and can easily visualize, and then populate that imagined place with images representing whatever you want to remember. Known as the “method of loci” by the Romans, such a building would later come to be called a “memory palace.” (Location 1327)</li>
  <li>But if we see or hear something exceptionally base, dishonorable, extraordinary, great, unbelievable, or laughable, that we are likely to remember for a long time.” (Location 1381)</li>
  <li>Heidegger’s Being and Time.” (Location 1467)</li>
  <li>The earliest memory treatises described two types of recollection: memoria rerum and memoria verborum, memory for things and memory for words. (Location 1688)</li>
  <li>Cicero agreed that the best way to memorize a speech is point by point, not word by word, by employing memoria rerum. (Location 1694)</li>
  <li>In his De Oratore, he suggests that an orator delivering a speech should make one image for each major topic he wants to cover, and place each of those images at a locus. (Location 1695)</li>
  <li>The brain is a costly organ. Though it accounts for only 2 percent of the body’s mass, it uses up a fifth of all the oxygen we breathe, and it’s where a quarter of all our glucose gets burned. The brain is the most energetically expensive piece of equipment in our body, and has been ruthlessly honed by natural selection to be efficient at the tasks for which it evolved. (Location 1711)</li>
  <li>Strip away the emotions, the philosophizing, the neuroses, and the dreams, and our brains, in the most reductive sense, are fundamentally prediction and planning machines. (Location 1716)</li>
  <li>And to work efficiently, they have to find order in the chaos of possible memories. (Location 1717)</li>
  <li>The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. (Location 1767)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> I can use this in my scripts to makes concepts stick in memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Words that rhyme are much more memorable than words that don’t; concrete nouns are easier to remember than abstract nouns; dynamic images are more memorable than static images; alliteration aids memory. (Location 1769)</li>
  <li>The anonymous author of the Ad Herrenium suggests that the best method for remembering poetry ad verbum is to repeat a line two or three times before trying to see it as a series of images. (Location 1805)</li>
  <li>“singularly simple-minded to believe that written words can do anything more than remind one of what one already knows.” (Location 1896)</li>
  <li>Writing, for Socrates, could never be anything more than a cue for memory—a way of calling to mind information already in one’s head. (Location 1897)</li>
  <li>
    <p>As Thomas Aquinas put it, “Things are written down in material books to help the memory.” (Location 1912)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our internal memories are associational, nonlinear. (Location 1983)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The historian Ivan Illich has argued that this represented an invention of such magnitude that “it seems reasonable to speak of the pre- and post-index Middle Ages.” (Location 1989)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To our memory-bound predecessors, the goal of training one’s memory was not to become a “living book,” but rather a “living concordance,” a walking index of everything one had read, and all the information one had acquired. (Location 1994)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the point of reading is, as it was for Peter of Ravenna, remembering, you approach a text very differently than most of us do today. (Location 2012)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“The First Steps Toward a History of Reading,” Robert Darnton describes a switch from “intensive” to “extensive” reading that occurred as books began to proliferate. (Location 2016)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“They had only a few books—the Bible, an almanac, a devotional work or two—and they read them over and over again, usually aloud and in groups, so that a narrow range of traditional literature became deeply impressed on their consciousness.” (Location 2018)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>around 1440, things began gradually to change. In the first century after Gutenberg, the number of books in existence increased fourteenfold. (Location 2020)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the sixteenth century, an Italian philosopher and alchemist named Giulio Camillo—known as “Divine Camillo” to his many admirers and “the Quack” to his many detractors—had the clever idea of making concrete what had for the previous two thousand years always been an ethereal idea.

    <p>real wooden building. He imagined creating a “Theater of Memory” that would serve as a universal library containing all the knowledge of mankind. (Location 2046)</p>
  </li>
  <li>assessment—Camillo’s reputation was resurrected in the twentieth century thanks to the efforts of the historian Frances Yates, who helped reconstruct the theater’s blueprints in her book The Art of Memory, and the Italian literature professor Lina Bolzoni, who has helped explain how Camillo’s theater was more than just the work of a nut job, but actually the apotheosis of an entire era’s ideas about memory.

  <li>Bell sees himself as the vanguard of a new movement that takes the externalization of memory to its logical extreme: a final escape from the biology of remembering. (Location 2145)</li>
  <li>Bell in his book Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything. (Location 2147)</li>
  <li>Bell has kept a digital “surrogate memory” to supplement the one in his brain. It ensures that a record is kept of anything and everything that might be forgotten. (Location 2149)</li>
  <li>He pulled up a time line of his life on his computer, found the phone conversation on it, and then immediately pulled up all the Web sites he was looking at while he was on the phone. (Location 2178)</li>
  <li>I used a technique known as the “Major System,” invented around 1648 by Johann Winkelmann, which is nothing more than a simple code to convert numbers into phonetic sounds. (Location 2232)</li>

  <li>What separates experts from the rest of us is that they tend to engage in a very directed, highly focused routine, which Ericsson has labeled “deliberate practice.” (Location 2333)</li>
