# Leadership

## [The Ride of a Lifetime](docs/highlights/books/the-ride-of-a-lifetime/index/) by [Robert Iger](docs/robert-iger/index/)

### Universal ideas for leadership

    - these strike me as universal ideas:
        - about fostering risk taking and creativity;
        - about building a culture of trust;
        - about fueling a deep and abiding curiosity in oneself and inspiring that in the people around you;
        - about embracing change rather than living in denial of it;
        - about operating, always, with integrity and honesty in the world, even when that means facing things that are difficult to face. ([LocationÂ 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=236))
