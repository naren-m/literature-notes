## snippent from [Outliers](logseq/bak/highlights/books/outliers/2024-10-05t08_51_53409zdesktop/)

- The particular skill that allows you to talk your way out of a murder rap, or convince your professor to move you from the morning to the afternoon section, is what the psychologist *Robert Sternberg* calls “[practical intelligence](docs/practical-intelligence/index/).”

  - ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001ANYDAO&location=1090))

- To Sternberg, [practical intelligence](docs/practical-intelligence/index/) includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.”
