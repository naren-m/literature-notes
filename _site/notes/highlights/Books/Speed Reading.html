<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The key is to determine why you are reading the text or what you want to know once finished. If reading for an assignment, you might ask why the instructor assigned the chapter or section. Two universal examples include: What can I get out of this material or How will reading it help me?

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Key is fto know ehy you are reading what you are reading</li>

  <li>Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life’s coming attractions—Albert Einstein (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B07HQM9G1R&amp;location=289">Location 289</a>)</li>
  <li>The first thing I do in a new place is to walk around and explore for a few hours. Doing so really sets my expectations of what the destination has to offers, and how much time I need or want to spend there.   This is how I want you to approach reading. I want you to preview material before reading it. That means scrolling through the text, scanning the table of contents, major headings, any words in bold or italics, visual aids, and any information that seems relevant.   Preview is one of the most valuable steps readers can take to improve reading speed and comprehension. That’s because previewing gives the mind a framework of what will be discussed. It helps the mind understand the type of information that will be presented and how it will be organized.

  <li>These experiences happen because the mind is perpetually preparing for the unexpected—such as a predator jumping out at you. If you can react to a dangerous event before it happens, you are likely to survive it.  At the same time, if you can anticipate an opportunity before the competition, you can take advantage. So, it is extremely useful to make snap judgments about the environment and to act on those judgments.   To do that, the mind makes predictions from a series of clues. It acts and reacts based on those predictions rather than on reality. In other words, we respond to people not based on what they are saying, but on what we assume they are going to say. We react to situations not based on the outcome, but rather on our fear and anticipation of the outcome.
