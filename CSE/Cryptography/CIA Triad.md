- ## Integrity
  
  Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.
  
  [[Hashing]] algorithms are used to confirm integrity.
- ## Availability
  
  Availability means resources and services are available as expected.
  
  Digital signatures, a combination of [[Hashing]] and [[Encryption]], can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
