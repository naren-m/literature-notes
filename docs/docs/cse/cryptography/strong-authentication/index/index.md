# Strong Authentication


User verification 
	1. That is robust and can with stand attacks on the system
	2. Authentication based on a Challenge response 
		Similar to Zero-knowledge-proof, where you donâ€™t have to present the password (or a cryptographic entity to prove the possession of it) itself but you prove to the system that you possess the password.
