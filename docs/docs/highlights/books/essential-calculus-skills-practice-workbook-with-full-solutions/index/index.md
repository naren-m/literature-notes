- Given a polynomial term of the form axb (where a is a constant coefficient and b is a constant exponent), to take a derivative with respect to the variable x, first multiply the coefficient a by the exponent b, and then reduce the exponent by 1 according to the following formula: Note that a few special exponents can make a polynomial look somewhat different: • If you see a variable in a denominator, you may bring it to the numerator by negating its exponent according to the following rule: • If you see a squareroot, rewrite it using an exponent of ½: • If no coefficient or exponent is observed, the number 1 is implied: It may help to recall the following rules of algebra regarding exponents: ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GPN9NJK&location=74))
- If a polynomial includes multiple terms, find the derivative of each term individually and then add the results together: For example, if y1 = 4x2, y2 = –3x, and y3 = 6, this means: Note that the derivative of a constant equals zero: ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GPN9NJK&location=83))
