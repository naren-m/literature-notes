# idempotent

Same results for the action performed repeatedly.

- Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby
- They can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
- The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in
    - abstract algebra (in particular, in the theory of projectors and closure operators) and
    - functional programming (in which it is connected to the property of referential transparency).
