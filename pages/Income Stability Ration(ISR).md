- The **Income Stability Ratio (ISR)** is a formula designed to determine exactly how much corpus an investor needs to achieve financial freedom and retire comfortably without exhausting their principal, even during market downturns. It moves away from "linear return" assumptions (hoping for 10-12% every year) and instead calculates the amount of **stable, low-volatility money** required to support a specific monthly income.
- ### **The ISR Formula**
  
  The formula is calculated as follows:
  
  $$\text{ISR} = \frac{\text{Stable Income Bucket} + \text{Low Volatility Bucket} + \text{Equity Bucket}}{\text{Annual Withdrawal Requirements}}$$
- #### **1. The Numerator: The Three Buckets**
-
- To calculate the top half of the ratio, you must total the assets in three distinct categories:
-
	- **Stable Income Bucket:** Includes safe debt, floater funds, short-term funds, arbitrage funds, and "SWP safe" assets like equity savings funds.
	- **Low Volatility Bucket:** Includes hybrid funds, conservative funds, balance advantage funds, and low-volatility multi-asset funds.
	- **Equity Bucket:** Consists of long-term pure equity funds, such as flexicap and multicap funds.
-
- #### **2. The Denominator: Annual Withdrawal Requirements**
- This is calculated by taking your **desired monthly income and multiplying it by 12**. For example, if you want ₹1 lakh per month, your annual withdrawal requirement is ₹12 lakhs.

- ### **Interpreting the Ratio**
- The resulting number tells you the safety level and sustainability of your retirement plan:
	- **Below 17.5 (High Risk):** You are at a high risk of failure. Withdrawals are likely unsustainable in bad market years, and "sequence of return risk" is high.
	- **17.5 to 20 (Acceptable):** This range is considered acceptable if market returns remain normal and inflation is controlled.
	- **Greater than 24 (Comfortable):** You are in a "comfortable financial freedom zone." Withdrawals remain stable even in volatile periods, and you do not need to touch your growth (equity) buckets even if the market falls.
-
- ### **Practical Example**
-
- If an investor wants ₹1 lakh per month (₹12 lakhs per year) and aims for a target **ISR of 17.5**, the required corpus is **₹2.1 crores**.
- **Calculation:** $12\text{ lakhs (Annual Requirement)} \times 17.5\text{ (ISR)} = 2.1\text{ Crores}$.
- Under the "Squirreling Strategy," this total is ideally split into three roles: ₹70 lakhs for stability, ₹70 lakhs for income, and ₹70 lakhs for growth.
-
- The sources emphasize that using ISR helps debunk the **"5 crore myth,"** proving that with a disciplined 3-bucket arrangement, financial freedom is achievable with a much lower total corpus.

  **Analogy:**
  Think of the ISR as a **"Stress Test" for a bridge**. The **Annual Withdrawal Requirement** is the weight of the traffic trying to cross every day. The **three buckets** are the pillars supporting the bridge. The **ISR** is the engineer's calculation that tells you if those pillars are strong enough to hold the traffic during a massive earthquake (market crash). If your ratio is above 24, your bridge is "over-engineered" for safety, meaning you can sleep soundly even when the ground starts to shake.
