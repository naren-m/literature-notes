# Ayurvedam

Ayurveda ("Knowledge of Life") is the traditional system of medicine originating in India over 5,000 years ago. It represents one of the world's oldest medical systems, emphasizing prevention, holistic treatment, and the balance of mind, body, and spirit.

## Foundational Principles

### Tridosha Theory
The cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine based on three fundamental energies:

#### 1. Vata (Air + Space)
- **Functions**: Movement, circulation, breathing, nervous system
- **Characteristics**: Dry, light, cold, rough, subtle, mobile
- **Imbalance symptoms**: Anxiety, insomnia, constipation, joint pain
- **Location**: Colon, thighs, bones, joints, ears

#### 2. Pitta (Fire + Water)
- **Functions**: Metabolism, digestion, transformation, intelligence
- **Characteristics**: Hot, sharp, light, oily, liquid, mobile
- **Imbalance symptoms**: Anger, inflammation, acidity, skin disorders
- **Location**: Small intestine, liver, heart, brain, eyes

#### 3. Kapha (Earth + Water)
- **Functions**: Structure, immunity, lubrication, stability
- **Characteristics**: Heavy, slow, steady, solid, cold, soft, oily
- **Imbalance symptoms**: Depression, obesity, congestion, diabetes
- **Location**: Chest, throat, head, sinuses, joints

### Panchamahabhuta (Five Elements)
The fundamental building blocks of all matter:
1. **Akasha (Space)** - Provides room for all processes
2. **Vayu (Air)** - Movement and communication
3. **Agni (Fire)** - Transformation and metabolism
4. **Jal (Water)** - Fluidity and cohesion
5. **Prithvi (Earth)** - Structure and stability

### Prakriti and Vikriti
- **Prakriti**: Individual's natural constitution (genetic blueprint)
- **Vikriti**: Current state of doshic balance/imbalance
- **Goal**: Align Vikriti with Prakriti for optimal health
