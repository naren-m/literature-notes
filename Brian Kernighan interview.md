Kernighan coined the term "Unix" and helped popularize Thompson's [[Unix philosophy]].[17] Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression "What You See Is All You Get" (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG).[18] Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

In 1972, Kernighan described memory management in strings using "hello" and "world", in the B programming language,[19] which became the iconic example we know today. Kernighan's original 1978 implementation of [[Hello World]] was sold at The Algorithm Auction, the world's first auction of computer algorithms.
