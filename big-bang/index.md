# Big Bang

- point—to forge these heavy elements, you need the kind of heat and energy of a [Big Bang](docs/big-bang/index/). Yet there has been only one [Big Bang](docs/big-bang/index/) and it didn't produce them. So where did they come from? Interestingly, the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who heartily despised the [Big Bang](docs/big-bang/index/) as a theory and coined the term “[Big Bang](docs/big-bang/index/)” sarcastically, as a way of mocking it.
