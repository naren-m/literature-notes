# Initialization Vector

An initialization vector (IV) adds another ingredient to the asymmetric [encryption](cse/cryptography/encryption/) algorithm, which makes the digest less predictable. Adversaries can use predictability to glean information from patterns and exploit [security vulnerabilities](security/security-vulnerabilities/). For that reason, an IV makes [encryption](cse/cryptography/encryption/) more secure.
