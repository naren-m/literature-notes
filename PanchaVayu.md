# PanchaVayu


The Sanskrit word [[Vayu]] translates as “wind,” and the root ‘va’ translates to “that which flows.”

Thus a Vayu is an energetic force that moves in a specific direction to control bodily functions and activities.

The ancient yogis found 49 distinct types of Vayus in the body.

Only five of the main Vayus or Pancha Pranas are important for yoga practitioners to understand.

These five primary currents of vital force are

1. Prana-Vayu
2. Apana-Vayu
3. Samana-Vayu
4. Udana-Vayu
5. Vyana-Vayu
