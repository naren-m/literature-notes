[[VishnuSahasranamam]]
00:00:00 the blessings of bhumi Devi and mahalakshmi so she was called bhuma so he brought up this girl bhuma with so much of love and this girl of four or five years took up to cooking because her father was always engaged in austerity somebody had to cook so she started cooking one day an aged person in a few days from then he will die that kind of an aged person he walked towards the Hermitage of Mark and dear Maharishi and said markandeya I need to find a good braid markandeya asked for your grandson no no

00:00:43 for me Mark India did not know what to reply to this old man he was one foot on the grave but he was worried that that man will end up cursing him so he said why have you approached me sir I heard that you have a little girl in your house so she's a little girl call her ask her whether she is in agreement to Marry Me Marry Me sir she she doesn't know what proportion of salt is to be added to food don't worry my doctor is also advised have less salt I will not have salt from now on call your daughter the daughter came

00:01:25 Mark and day I thought the daughter will reject him outright she said if at all have to marry I'll marry only him what do you find attractive in this man to that girl alone that old man appeared as a young man he was none but the Lord himself so he said I choose to be a person whose abstained from Salt throughout my life but then she said don't call yourself like by these names what is your husband's name saltless man if somebody asks what is your husband's name Mr saltless I will give you one definition the wife

00:02:08 said the one who has no match why because he is the one and the only one the one God so he says whom should I reach there so in upayam itself remember this in upayam itself the questions are split into two foreign [Music] that which is the that who is the final one to be attained and that one who has to be attained where comes the next questions means is Abode what is the Abode of narayana it is called srivaikundam or paramapadam that is what is mentioned now before getting to this one general question I will ask who is a nastika

00:03:15 huh who does not believe in God you agree huh very good the one who doesn't believe in Vedas is called nastika remember this if you have to answer technically in sanatana Dharma you if they ask you who is an atheist you give that definition one who believes in no God asthika means one who says vedam is there the one who doesn't believe that Vedas are not true is called nastika okay now coming to the point suggests whom I have to attain Ed where I have to attain that was the second now these two questions are related to

00:04:07 upayam come to question number three four five six upayam student come whom should I do stuti off whom should I do archana off upon which manavas like us will Attain auspiciousness fifth question in your opinion which is the Dharma the best of all dharmas [Music] of whom one can get rid of this worldly material bondage these are the six questions question number one and two is about upayam question number three four five six is about upayam now I am going to divide the four questions further into

00:05:17 three categories question number three and four is about siddha upayam question number five is about sadhya upayam question number six is about Salam banopayam early morning you are this lecture is between our mouth and bisibility see in school days early morning if you have a history session after lunch break if you have grammar class equivalent to that is Vishnu sahasranamam class on a Sunday morning but I can't help he has commented that we go ask bhishma why question number three and four is about

00:06:11 what is siddha siddha means that which is ready siddham means ready see if somebody asks sir we have to leave for the lecture are you ready I am siddham means I am ready siddha upayam is the Lord himself because he is the one who's always ready this is question number five question number six which is Japan Japan through which of the Japanese can we attain him so the six questions are ready question number one and two is about upayam question number three four five six is about upayam question number

00:06:59 three and four about are about siddha upayam question number five question number six now question number three and four are divided further which is Lagu City question number four is and when that answer comes we'll explain now bhishma acharya thought first of all he liked yudhisthira and he liked his questions see generally when there is a question answered session in most of the other places one of the easiest ways to keep the person who's asking the question quiet is to give that remark your

00:07:43 question is good good question sir it will be a waste question but if we tell that only he will be happy and he will sit ES so but here yudhisthira tells asks genuine questions and bhishma charya tells but he says I will give answer in my own way you should give the Liberty to the person right that is when he starts telling the answer I will tell you what is the answer for every question you'll have to map that he starts answering for the sixth question first he says I'll answer the sixth question

00:08:27 first [Music] um so this is the answer to the sixth question Kim Japan so he says the one who is not bound by space and time purus who is Prabhu Kalyan Jewelers [Music] see how do we dis derive at the word purushottama I will tell you how the word comes anybody with the name purushottama here anybody who knows somebody with the name purushotama here are very good so you go and tell them what their name means they have a wonderful name whether they are like that or not the name is wonderful there are three tatvas in vedanta

00:09:30 ishwara achit means that which is not substratum to knowledge that which doesn't give space to knowledge is called that which gives space to knowledge is called chit jivatma is called chit the one who controls achit and chit is called ishwara okay this chith is divided into three we are all bound by Karma so we are called badhatma if at all we attain moksham we will get green card now we are H1B Visa holders once we get green card we'll become muktatma the original people who are staying in vaikuntam above origins or the natural

00:10:15 native people are called as nithyatma so divatma is divided into badhatma muktatma nithyatma you you sir wait it'll get easy don't worry so there are five ishwara is called purusha purushaha is different from so he is called utpurusha he is different from badatma he's called uttara purusha then he is called uttama purusha purusha uttara purusha uttama purusha since he is different from every tatva found in this world he is called uttama Tama in samskirta means EST we say right tallest EST that is

00:11:11 the best amongst purushas so what was the answer has okay for this the name corresponding to this in sahasranamam is the Nama 685 it is called have you heard of this what does Tava priyaha means the one who loves being celebrated in any way the devotee celebrates he is which means whatever mistakes we do in the aradhanam we should try avoiding but you don't have to worry because many people say you know in today's Puja I offered the tulasi first and then later what will happen nothing will happen

00:12:20 first of all discard fear when you reach the Lord he is more merciful and lovable than your own parents even your parents may have disagreements with you but the Lord will never have any disagreement with you so in the last 100 years we have done lot of damage to sanatana Dharma if God does harm to his devotees he's not God remember this he is greater than our mother why will he harm us so when you are doing Puja or aradhanam however simple or however humble it is do it with love do not do it with fear

00:13:07 is there a way that God is benevolent can you give an example I'll give you an example from charitra even today there is an utsavam called in all the vaishnava temples you know what they will do in front of the deity the Mula deity they will put a huge waste dhoti and they will make many many vegetables together they will make one visibility bath and put it in front of him it is called kadambasadam then the entire town that day they won't cook they will come with their the bus they will take the prasadam and go

00:13:50 so thousand years before this ceremony had to happen in Sri rangam this utsavam got ready vegetables were being cut Nick day two this utsavam was supposed to happen and on that day too when this utsavam happens where before Lord SRI ranganatha the the cooked rice is kept in front of him on that day the reigning preceptor of that region acharya has to come in front of the Lord and then the priest will say yeah he will say oh acharya come here the acharya has to receive the tirtham of the Lord first and as soon as he

00:14:26 receives the other devotees will receive and the prasadam will be distributed amongst the devotees this is the procedure on day one the previous day ramanuja went on a Expedition he went city after City Village after Village and he was returning to srirangam so while returning to srirangam from the northern part of srirangam he had to cross the tributary to kaveri called as kolidam generally collidum is not a tributary where there is lot of water you have to walk on their signs and come towards the corner where there was wet

00:15:16 sand he saw a group of four or five children seated and playing he was wondering what are they playing on these wet Sands he went closer he saw that these children maybe of four years five years six years seven years they had made a replica of srirangam Temple with that wet sand and inside that sanctum sanctorum the replica was this small in that there was a Garba gram and inside that they had kept one small bamboo stick in the place of ranganatha and opposite that bamboo stick they had made small cups which were akin to the

00:15:54 silver cups that you have in the sanity and kaveri water was kept in those small tiny cups and one of the students thought that he is the priest and the other student has to be ramanuja so the other student who was of five years age he was holding three sticks together tiridandi sannyasi so this boy priest said he had made taken some sand and kept it in front of that bamboo who is akin to ranganatha and that sand was busy bele bath so this boy who's the priest like how it would happen on day two

00:16:35 where when the priest says Dr ramanuja has to come he said yeah the other boy who's ramanuja comes in front I am here and that boy the priest boy had to give that little water because they are enacting what would happen the next day but to their surprise when that little boy said yeah who was witnessing this from a distance came running and he put his palm in the front this boy was surprised how is my friend's Palm so big he looked this side he found that gigantic personality of ramanja he did not know what to react this boy of four

00:17:14 or five years to that man of over 80 or 90 years said please give me that water he took that little Cup made out of kaveri sand and put poured that water into ramanuja's Palm was supposed to happen tomorrow has happened today stop the utsavam tomorrow the CC has asked why I could see ranganatha in that little mantapam with the child has made ranganatha is not just in that sanctum sanctorum he is in that little stick what this little boy has made because he is tawa priyaha whatever you call him he will accept

00:18:02 that you know andal the Mystic poetess she tells that you all think there are only thousand names of Vishnu and sahasranamam correct thousand names she says there's a thousand oneth name generally when people give gifts for functions they will always make the thousand one hundred and one what is the Thousand oneth name andal tells the one who does not know the pain or the agony what women have that is his thousandth name what is this thousand one's name the one who doesn't know the agony of women that is a thousand one

00:18:37 thing the Lord says if andal gives me that I will accept that also great so that is the answer to the sixth question answer to the sixth question what is the sixth question okay now let us go to the question number four what was the question number four question number four was so whom should I do archana of what is who is archana she is a singer who is archana my granddaughter archana what does archana mean you go to a temple sir 50 rupees yesterday they'll give one ticket you will go there hey Winger Gotham

00:19:39 okay then he'll go the priest will go inside we will be absolutely disconnected to what he's saying he will make sure that he is not audible outside huh from this place he will start he'll go inside then how will you know he has completed the last two namas will have one tone um you'll take the 10 rupee coin because nobody accepts 10 rupee coins who will accept only the Lord will accept you will take the 10 rupee coin and archana is done this is the archana's tone antenna today but what is archana for

00:20:34 eign that's all see we should not assume what we get as praises to be true I would have I would have forgotten two slokas your name I should not take that seriously I should take it in that too but the Lord is absolutely conversant and eligible for receiving our praises but how do we go and praise him we are not that Adept see neither do we know sastram in detail nor can we remember our itihasas and puranas called UPA brahmanam in detail that is why our rishis who are very generous kind and benevolent have themselves created those

00:21:33 set pattern of praises the one who is the one who has created that is the one who is knowledge herself the one who thinks good for all the creatures in her creation the one who is a personification of utmost devotion the one who accompanies Agni during all The Vedic injunctions the one who accompanies all Vedic aphorisms that attract the pitrus it is called swada the one who is the better half to the Lord the one who is present in the eloquence of a person the one who is Seated on the Lotus whose

00:22:43 petals give only Radiance and exuberance [Music] the one who is as wit and merciful as the Lotus which blossoms with the connection of the Serene Waters of a pond this is what archanais so our rishis have created this pattern and they have said when you go to a temple you may not be Adept enough to sing at least listen to that Chana that listen word is only a problem for us correct so two things are meant to make any archana successful one the person who is wanting to do archana should listen the one who is doing archana should be

00:23:28 sincere when you go to a temple now from now on you make it a point you are paying for an archana listen to it and if there is a priest who's listening to it let them do it sincerely you may be wondering sir poor thing how many times he'll be doing he has taken up that as his job Dharma he has to do it so what is the fourth question whom should I do archana off foreign ask six questions when answer was the same you're getting my point for all the answers you know what bhishma tells it is the same narayana

00:24:25 who to whom archana has to be done it is the same archana who is the only God it is the same narayana who's the Dharma is to get one answer why should you ask six questions because in the Loki Ka pattern in our mundane pattern we have different Ministries allotted mahalakshmi means she will give gold tomorrow if you have fever she has not studied medicine that is our understanding if you go to Hayek griva he will give you knowledge tomorrow if you want money no no no he is not concerned with Finance no credit risk no Market risk he

00:25:05 doesn't know all that this is our way of understanding sanatana Dharma understand this way if narayana can grant moksham he can also grant us 10 Rupees correct so the one who grants moksham is adept of granting us knowledge material pleasures and so on how do we know that in Sri bhagavad-gita you have the shloka what Krishna tells again this is a very important shloka Gita is something that you you know some people say what are you doing these days I'm reading Gita I have to fall at their feet because when you read Gita if there is

00:25:45 someone who can understand Gita by just reading they are to be celebrated at the level of ADI shankara and ramanuja because in my humble opinion you can never understand Gita by taking the book of Gita it's very tough it's everywhere the shloka will be said karma Arjuna do your duty don't expect the fruits is it really something that you believe in your child studies to go to Berkeley or Harvard see you study don't do it with the aim of going to Berkeley or Harvard how will you say this so first of all our understanding

00:26:26 of Gita itself is wrong if Gita was so simple would have not commented at all so you need someone to explain now let me take this loka have you heard of the slokamam um four classes of people propitiate me they do it to get good deeds who are they asked Arjuna are Taha jignas four categories of people he says what does artha mean very good the one who is in distress if you are in pain you're called artha RT means the one who is suffering sir I thought it was aarti that is harthi ha h a that is means you are giving distress to Ganga

00:27:52 in sanskritam aarti is not arti that is should come trouble foreign it is better you stick to giving names to your grandchildren from the Lakshmi ashtotram don't try something new you'll end up giving names which don't mean actually right the one who is in distress correct but there is an other meaning to our remember this the one who has lost wealth but gains it back is called so suppose you have lost your cell phone sir don't even say that sir our Atma is inside that you know in those days the demon will not have the Atma in him

00:28:47 the Atma will be inside a parrot the parrot will be in a cage that cage will be in a cave that cave will be in an island that Island will be far away so our hero will go take the boat get inside that cave win all the odds kill that parrot then the demon will die is in our cell phone right just assume your cell phone is lost for a minute 21 passwords have been saved in that four gate payment gateways are there in it inside that in when the flap cover you will find those credit cards your aadhar your adharam is

00:29:28 there that is lost you are extremely depressed worried next day well you are worried you 've been sharing this Agony with everybody whom you know somebody knocks at your door is this your phone I found it at the end of Brigade Road lying I saw your address and I brought it so you had wealth you lost it and you have gained it you are called our Taha arthriti means the one who has never had wealth but is gaining for the first time so both of them are associated with wealth he had wealth he lost it he

00:30:15 gained it he gets New Wealth put together they are called Aishwarya there is another person called means the one who wants wants to know more about his jivatma that person is called last comes the category where the person wants to know about the Lord he is called bhagavalla bharti or gyani so Krishna tells Arjuna there are four categories of people Arjuna are Taha and together are Aishwarya wants to understand me all people seek asylum in me thereby there is no Ministry allocation in sanatana Dharma

00:31:08 Lakshmi will take care of Finance she is nirmala Mommy there is who will take care of army he is rajnath vishwakarma will take care of Roads he's got Curry in fact sanatana Dharma is like the current pmo everything will be taken care only by him so the question is answer is what is the example to that you have to do archana to him archana to whom archana to the one who listens to us see you think we are listening to the Lord impossible we can never listen to the Lord because we have the Habit to never listen to

00:32:20 anybody so if at all somebody has to bend the door the Lord has to bend he listens to us agree with it yes I will read out the nama 627th nama foreign [Music] see some of you may be wondering sir we thought a lecture like this will be very engaging very simple you are quoting Sanskrit lines see lectures cannot be as simple as the way we think now that the father commands you I cannot keep saying all these sentences okay this is how my lectures are I will read out from the pramana is the one who listens to his devotees

00:33:40 does he listen to his devotees sir yes I will give you two examples three examples for this one this is a ketram which is found reference even in the sangam literature of the ancient Tamil land it is called see certain names if you are not a Tamil origin speaking person you have to learn these namas no other go if you want to learn more about sanatana Dharma language should not be your barrier so how do we go to this it is next to SM silks and babusha in kanchipuram you can buy one korvai mountain border sarri

00:34:25 and if you have time you can visit the Lord he is not that important okay it is the Lord is called yet in sanskritam why because there is a charitram to this the Lord was reclining there he's called Vega setu the other name is Vega setu he was the bridge to the river called vegavati he was the first encroachment which the bbmp never cleared he lay laid on the river called vegavati he slept he did not want the river to destroy brahma's yagam in the same shetram was a Mystic saint called as thiru Marissa piran

00:35:07 this saint was extremely devoted to the Lord and always engaged in deep penance he was served by a student called Kani kannan and another lady who used to come and sweep his ashram May after many many months out of sheer deep Penance this Rishi opened his eyes piran opened his eyes the moment he opened his eyes the lady who was standing in front and doing she was a very old lady she was sweeping she turned into a 16 year old young woman 16 year old girl since she was in tamilnadu she was singing sindura

00:35:52 she has reached 16 sure she started singing that song by the rishi's grace she became a young woman and she started walking by the streets of kanchipuram the pallavaraja who ruled that time was amazed to see this beautiful lady a personification of blemishless beauty he asked I have never seen you in kanchipuram where are you from the king gust he said I was always in kanchipuram but I have turned young because of this great saint called as thirumarishi piran's eye glances that fell on me now this King said even I am getting old

00:36:29 I have been trying to do so many anti-wrinkle treatments L'Oreal has not been that helpful this upping there is one upping treatment you have to take and you have to do this um pap smear and you will get nice skinny little it will grow you will be competing with the Lord and his Beauty so with all this technology this King said even I should become beautiful let him look at me also he said see he is not in the profession of looking at people you stand in a queue he'll keep looking at you he just like that he opened his

00:37:13 eyes it fell on me I turned don't do all this with him he called the king called summoned the Rishi student called kanikandan come here ask your Guru to come to my court and ask him to look at me you wouldn't said sir my Guru is not such a cheap person he is completely into Bhagavad bhakti he will not come if you are not listening to the words that I have commanded it is better that he quit this particular City you don't have to live in my jurisdiction as you come answer he went to his teacher Swami acharya the King has asked me to

00:37:57 leave the city I'm leaving after the student left for a moment the acharya thought the people call me a guru my only student has left then how can I call myself a guru are you a teacher yes do you have students no then how are you a teacher if my student has left what job have I as a teacher to stay in this place I even also leave the city he left as he left he saw the Lord of kanchipuram lying on looking with he was looking in a way see your student has left you have left what will I do when I don't have a bhakta like you

00:38:42 when the Lord showed such eyes of a very very pitiable State the Alvar said my student has gone so am I going oh the Lord with lotus like ice you don't have to stay here take your mat which is the Thousand hooded snake roll it keep it under your armpit and walk along with me the Lord walked along with him then he went and stayed in a village for one night that night he stayed there this pallava Kingdom lost electricity Dirty Water started getting mixed with good water all food grains were affected with ants

00:39:42 and termites the King was wondering what could have happened then he sensed that something equal to a Calamity has happened he goes to the place where are the Lord and his student infestation he tells please come back I've committed a grave Mistake by sinning against you please come back now the Lord has to follow the law kanikandan left so did the acharya go and then the Lord also followed them back to the original place called now spread your snake mat and sleep yesterday he said take your snake mat

00:40:23 and walk with me he walked today you spread it and sleep he slept he listens to his devotees so he's called vidhay Atma there is another shetram very close to Chennai called Asura in this there was a Rishi calledra so this Rishi was so devoted that the Lord came in the form of an old man and asked where can I sleep where should I sleep which is the room where I have to sleep then the Rishi said this is the place and as he slept the Rishi realized he was none other than the Lord and he said you have to sleep here permanently so he

00:41:06 slept there is one anecdote which what is that mean he accepts what his devotee gives whatever you give see even our home cooked food he receives it you you must realize how merciful he is with that so one of the greatest scenes in the vaishnava tradition called used to give an anecdote it seems after krishna's marriage too many was from Maharashtra now he settled in Gujarat so in a bullet train speed he took her from nagpur to jamnagar Gujarat he settled there from sabudana khichdi suddenly she has to have dhokla

00:41:58 one afternoon as they were talking Krishna had a very upset stomach and he went and vomited rukmani asked what food I had you also had why are you vomiting no no I had something more what is that more see yesterday one of the persons who manages many bovine risks cattle in dwaraka had very very old food and water cooked for the cows the cow is generally very not very fussy in nature whatever he gives is here those cows accepted but yesterday he gave such tail food to the cows that the cow refused to

00:42:47 consume that this man who lives in dwaraka rukmani was so upset I have cooked such good food for you you call it stale food and you're not having Mr Cow he offered it to the ground Krishna saying Krishna let Krishna take it if my devotees give even stale food I accept that since I consumed that yesterday my stomach is upset today so he's called vidhayatma the answer to the fourth question next answer to the third question what is the third question the answer is [Music] [Music] you'll be away from all your worries if

00:44:06 you recite this particular lord's name he says next after this comes the answer to the fifth question what was the fifth question correct now the answer is he himself so whom should I do archana narayana whom should I do narayana whom should I do Japan who's the only one narayana who is the parama Dharma narayana so he says Kim Japan so here he says for that the answer is one who has got life Lotus like it's very good what does pundarika mean very good means White Lotus remember this it is not pink or red Lotus

00:45:27 how do we know that from amarakosha what is Amara kosha

[Part 8/8 | Vishnu Sahasranama Vaibhavam | ENGLISH | Dushyanth Sridhar | The Six Questions & Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aPjzSGfwZM)

00:00 so here he says
00:03 for that the answer is
00:11 one who has got
00:15 Lotus like it's very good what does
00:17 pundarika mean
00:20 very good
00:24 means White Lotus remember this it is
00:28 not pink or red Lotus
00:30 how do we know that
01:36 dictionary who gave us the dictionary
01:38 a Buddhist gave us the dictionary it is
01:42 called amarakosha
01:43 generally you know there will always be
01:45 a debate now that was ignited Buddhism
01:47 Hinduism
01:50 traditionally Buddhism when it emerged
01:53 it was against the tenets of sanatana
01:56 Dharma Buddha opposed the tenets of
01:59 sanatana Dharma so
01:01 slowly over a period of time Buddhism
01:03 started integrating with sanatana Dharma
01:08 but the beauty is in those days May
01:11 acharya used to state
01:13 unless and until you were completely
01:15 cognizant of sanatana dharma's
01:18 principles
01:19 you were not allowed to debate with the
01:21 Buddhist in those days
01:24 you required
01:25 extremely talented debating skills to
01:29 debate with the Buddhists that is why it
02:32 it took a lot of years for Kumar in a
02:35 bhatta to achieve that and after
02:37 kumarilla bhatta's time ADI shankara
02:39 took over that huge onus of debating
02:42 with the Buddhists today if I talk about
02:45 Buddhism simple things we know Buddha
02:47 will be seated like this
02:49 correct 1 then
02:56 this is all too basic
02:59 the way they debated was on four classes
02:02 of Buddhists they were called
02:04 vaibhashikas
02:07 yoga Chara and madhyamika they were the
02:11 four big groups of people which shankara
02:14 debated and later that baton was given
02:17 to ramanuja he had to debate
02:20 just giving you an egg just one or two
02:23 lines about Buddhism
02:25 there were certain texts called Asics
03:36 so Pali was the language which he
03:39 adopted so Buddha thought Sanskrit may
03:42 beat
03:43 construed as a language only for the
03:45 scholars let us use Pali how will Pali
03:48 sound I will give you an example
03:56 this is Pali
03:59 foreign
03:25 some people used only certain sutras of
03:28 it they were called
04:30 some people beg to differ from them and
04:34 treated yoga as a principle they were
04:36 called yoga charas then after yogachara
04:39 came people who thought we have to be
04:41 middle men in Buddhism they were called
04:42 madhyamikas the four classes of people
04:45 were further distilled into two called
04:48 hinayana and Mahayana
04:51 that is how Buddhism all this they
04:54 flourished at one point in time Buddhism
04:56 was at its peak during the 5th 6th 7th
04:59 8th centuries after shankara's time with
04:02 his debating skills because in those
04:03 days you don't have to lift one sword
04:06 grenade and all of that simple you have
04:09 to call a person for a debate
04:11 he has to has to send his thoughts
04:14 postulates
04:15 either
04:20 or I have to negate and present what I
04:22 have to give to him
04:24 each of this had one name this debate
04:27 three kinds of debate existed jalpam
05:30 vitandam and vadam three forms of debate
05:34 now we have brought all of bitandavatam
05:36 you can never mix
05:38 withandam is one style vadam is another
05:42 jalpam is another
05:44 so if a person loses
05:47 then he has to come to my side so
05:49 shankara started winning people through
05:51 debates he never used Force then
05:54 ramanuja continued in a big way and he
05:57 fought against the jaints because
05:59 Jainism was earlier to Buddhism people
05:03 think Buddhism as far as Jainism is next
05:05 no Jainism is older to Buddhism how
05:09 because
05:11 can I just take five minutes and then is
05:13 it okay or am I digressing
05:15 it is okay okay
05:19 questions now
05:23 in Jainism
05:25 they use two vadams two philosophies one
05:28 is called the other one is called
06:33 two philosophies
06:37 was completely on possibility
06:52 so Gina he is called Gina or arihanta
06:56 you have heard of the word
06:57 means one who knows everything
06:00 he gave from rishabhanatha's time he
06:02 started giving and this rishabhanata had
06:05 two sons I spoke about rishabanata in
06:08 the first 20 minutes remember
06:10 rishabanatha had two wives through those
06:12 two wives he had many sons the one of
06:14 the wives he had a son called bharata
06:17 who became
06:18 upon which our desam is called
06:20 bharatadesha
06:22 the other wife had a son called bahubali
06:26 sad
07:30 baahubali married whom
07:33 so this baahubali is called gomateshwara
07:37 you go to shravana belagola right so
07:40 this baahubali ishwara now this
07:44 baahubali's father
07:46 rishabhanata from the north
07:49 I'm talking about the region of uttar
07:51 Pradesh Nepal then he goes to girnar
07:54 parvatam in Gujarat
07:56 and professes Jainism and then comes
07:60 further south
07:03 is kurg
07:05 there he sheds his body
07:08 so Karnataka at one point in time became
07:11 the PowerHouse of Jainism
07:14 so after shankara's time in the 8th
07:17 Century ramanuja had to come in the 11th
07:19 century to fight the genes again when I
07:21 say if I don't think he was having a
07:23 truthandam the other person is having
07:25 one stick both of them were fighting you
07:26 have to win through debate
07:28 right ramanuja had a huge task Jane said
08:32 we will not agree to your one-to-one
08:34 debate
08:36 you debate you come as a single person
08:40 or many people but we will come as a
08:42 group asked how many we will come as a
08:45 group of 12 000.
08:47 and we will debate
08:49 we will keep throwing questions at you
08:52 and you have to answer that is
08:56 where he debated
08:58 and at the end of it and they gave the
08:01 entire hostel the monastery where James
08:05 used to stay for the temple to ramanuja
08:08 now so but today Buddhists and jains
08:12 have become a part of us
08:14 so you know they have accepted they do
08:15 Lakshmi Puja they do ganapati Puja every
08:18 Puja they do
08:20 so they have come into the system so
08:22 personally I have nothing against them
08:23 they are very welcome into sanatana
08:25 Dharma we can even do Pancha samskaram
08:27 and make them SRI vaishnavats but the
08:29 problem is
09:30 here
09:36 who is the one on what is the Dharma to
09:39 be taken
09:40 for which he says
09:45 he is the one who is the Dharma of all
09:48 dharmas who is that person
09:50 he is the one who is that he
09:53 so there is
09:05 White Lotus Buddhists have given that
09:09 it's okay we can use Buddhist dictionary
09:11 not a problem now how do I make it Pink
09:14 Lotus because if it is White Lotus and
09:16 you are telling the Lord's eyes like
09:17 White Lotus that means he is anemic
09:20 correct how do I make it Pink Lotus that
09:24 is why you say that the Lotus has the
09:27 redness akin to that of coral you have
10:30 to make Coral paste
10:32 apply it by the Petals of White Lotus
10:35 towards the edges the pink has to be
10:38 high towards the middle it has to be low
10:40 so you pluck one petal from the lotus
10:43 flower how will it be it will start it
10:45 will expand this much and at the end it
10:48 will come together correct so the eyes
10:51 of the Lord are like the Petals of a
10:55 Lotus
10:57 you should not keep Lotus the lotus
10:59 petal
10:00 it should have that red tinge towards
10:03 that end that was his aadhar card
10:06 see in many airports these days you
10:08 don't have to give your passport they
10:10 will do I scan
10:11 the machine will just run in front of
10:14 you so today if I go to the airport we
10:15 show that pan card he lets us in suppose
10:18 imagine the Lord is standing behind me
10:21 he has to get inside the airport the
10:23 security will not ask for the aadhar
10:26 card he will look into the eye if it is
10:27 the eyes of the Petals of a Lotus he
10:30 will be allowed inside because vedam
11:32 says
11:38 here she was humiliated right she goes
11:42 and tells her brothers who has done this
11:44 meeting this Injustice to use the
11:47 brothers
11:48 she tells the one with the eyes like the
11:52 Petals of a Lotus has chopped my nose
11:02 the one who has got Lotus like ice cut
11:06 my nose so beautifully
11:08 see even while praising the Lord you
11:10 have to tell he is the one with lotus
11:12 like ice
11:13 okay
11:15 even duryodhana says that so this
11:18 word pundari kaksha is very important so
11:21 he says
11:22 he is the one he's a Dharma for all now
11:26 next answer to question number two what
11:30 was the question number two mangadam
12:48 he is the pavitra of pavitra
12:51 mangala to mangala what is this sir
12:54 pavitra to pavitra mangala to mangala
12:57 now what are the objects in this world
12:00 that we think are very mangalakaram
12:04 yeah
12:06 turmeric uh
12:15 energy
12:19 all these objects
12:25 to turmeric
12:28 see we call turmeric mangalakaram how
13:30 did turmeric get that name because it is
13:33 akin to the color of mahalakshmi
13:36 so it has borrowed the color from
13:38 mahalakshmi and said see you are called
13:40 the god of mangaladevata
13:48 I am taking the color from your body
13:51 please give me auspiciousness too
13:54 haridra is called as mangalakaram
13:58 how do we know that CE
13:02 um
13:05 in srimad-bhagavatam she was kamsa's
13:08 closest stifferent she was in that
13:11 WhatsApp group V7
13:17 Uka all anti-social elements
13:21 together we're in kamsa's group
13:23 so he said
13:26 foreign he said you have to kill
13:29 children because her specialization was
14:32 killing children
14:35 her PhD was in killing children
14:38 so she applied virulent poison on her
14:41 bosoms and she went to krishna's house
14:43 she fed him Krishna consumed the poison
14:46 looking at his beautiful countenance for
14:49 a minute she too lactated there is a
14:52 condition called galactorrhea she
14:54 lactated the child consumed that milk
14:57 finally
14:59 was also taken and she felt dead on the
14:03 streets of gokulam
14:05 huge body
14:07 Nanda gopala wanted dispose this body
14:10 how to dispose
14:11 he brought the cutting instruments in
14:15 his house
14:16 and he asked the person opposite his
14:18 house you cut from that side I will cut
14:20 from this side so as they started
14:23 cutting the body of putana with the saw
14:27 what they expected was and a bracious
15:30 order that should emanate from her body
15:33 no but today tells a narayanim it was it
15:37 felt as if 3 4 Sandalwood trees were
15:40 burned together
15:42 how her body is smelling Sandalwood
15:44 because the Lord had touched her
15:47 pavitranam
15:50 pavitramangalam her body also became a
15:53 huge dick then the woman started coming
15:54 they said you cut that hand and you I'll
15:57 keep it in my house you get this this
15:60 part and give
15:01 it
15:07 now if you remember I spoke about the
15:11 first two questions
15:14 I said these two questions talk about
15:16 upayam in that I said the second
15:19 question question talks about parama
15:22 ayanam which is the final destination
15:24 yesterday I also said that about uh
15:28 555 that I will talk about uttarayanam
16:32 um
16:35 880 onwards
16:39 the next 11 namas talk about the exit of
16:45 the jivatma to by kuntam you can note
16:47 this down very important
16:50 foreign
16:25 gives the process of exiting
16:29 we can know that now because when it is
17:31 actually exiting we won't know
17:34 so it is better we know it now now that
17:37 time the knowledge will not come on
17:42 so the jivatma has to exit
17:45 for that shastram tells the first signal
17:49 is
17:51 will stop cooperating with you
17:56 the moment it starts not cooperating
17:58 don't think the jivatma will exit it
17:00 will take some time
17:02 the tongue will not know the taste
17:05 maybe the food is like that
17:07 we don't know
17:08 tongue will slow slowly start
17:12 will not be able to decipher that taste
17:15 the ears will not be able to hear that
17:18 well
17:19 the eyes will not be able to see that
17:21 way because
17:23 they are called indriya because the the
17:27 flashes that come to your eye
18:30 are reminiscent of what has happened in
18:33 the past
18:35 see at the age of three my grandfather
18:37 told me this is a light my eye has
18:40 captured that and has put it in the
18:42 pencil telling this light this object is
18:47 a light so when I'm at the age of five
18:49 and I see that I'll say light because at
18:51 the age of three my grandfather has told
18:53 me this is light so then I will know
18:56 light and maybe at another age elderly
18:58 age that person he will ask what is this
18:00 because there is no coordination between
18:03 the I and the memory
18:07 will start not cooperating with that
18:10 person one
18:12 then buddhi all this has association
18:15 with buddhi buddhi will start
18:17 cooperating less
18:19 at that point in time it will signal the
18:22 jivatma where is the jivatma
18:26 gulam you go from the mouth it will go
18:30 in a certain angulas you'll find the
19:32 tenth angula here here is the jibatma
19:36 there is a layer called diaphragm
19:39 just close to that shastram tells that
19:42 there is an inverted Lotus
19:46 now you will say I did 10 bypass
19:49 surgeries
19:50 I didn't find
19:52 it is in a micro level
19:54 that way when we didn't see that Corona
19:57 have you seen Corona even I have not
19:59 seen how much it troubled the entire
19:01 world for three years only if I see if I
19:03 believes your concept then you should
19:05 not believe Corona as well so there is
19:07 an inverted Lotus
19:09 inside that Lotus there is a jivatma and
19:13 from the Lotus emerges 101 Pathways it
19:17 is called Nadi
19:19 in yoga sastra there are 101 nadis
19:25 the hundred and first Nadi is connected
19:28 to the brahmarandram here
20:31 so when the jivatma departs it will take
20:33 that 101st Nadi it is called sushumna
20:38 upanishad talks about it even shaktas
20:41 through Kundalini Yoga will know
20:43 sushumna Nadi so the Jiva Atma has to
20:46 exit
20:48 travels in the first hundred nadis it
20:52 will be born again
20:55 that path which it takes to be born
20:58 again is called the southern path called
20:01 The Path filled with smoke
20:04 the hundred and first Nadi is called as
20:08 sushumna only if the jivatma takes the
20:12 101st Nadi it will go by a northern path
20:15 called as archiradi margam and will
20:18 never be born again interesting sir but
20:21 how will the jivad panu which path to
20:24 take
20:24 should we use GPS or what should we do
20:28 Atma during its life time does upasana
21:33 upasana is not worship
21:37 yoga which is then
21:41 will be directed to take the 101st Nadi
21:46 called sushumna Nadi so when the Jiva
21:49 Atma exits
21:51 the first
21:56 it
21:58 region or Abode it comes across as fire
21:02 that is called jyotihi the one who is
21:05 present as fire to direct the jivatma is
21:09 called by the 881st Nama Jyoti
21:13 next comes
21:23 to wait when the race of the Sun come it
21:27 is called the daytime
22:32 will not travel in the night
22:35 it will travel only during the day
22:38 then it has to in our geographical terms
22:40 it has to cross the troposphere the
22:42 jivatma then it has to go to the
22:44 stratosphere so it has to cross
22:47 suruchihi that is the 882ndama
22:50 book yes
22:02 it has to wait for the waxing phase
22:10 will travel else it will stop it will
22:13 wait for the next Shukla paksha to come
22:16 next
23:33 but there will be a slight delay
23:36 of that six months it has to wait for
23:38 that that is why bhishma waited foreign
23:02 two ironms make one year it is called
23:07 that is why to remind us that your
23:10 jivatma will take one year we do
23:14 means completion of a year vedam tells
23:18 that if you have to live a complete
23:19 human life the man or the woman have to
23:21 live for 120 years they have to
23:24 celebrate the purtis it's called
23:29 ramanuja is the one who has celebrated
24:31 to suchta put these on his 120th year he
24:34 left to such step the puttis
24:47 see after troposphere Stratosphere
24:50 ionosphere and exosphere you will reach
24:53 the atmospheric boundary till that vayu
24:57 you will come along with you vayu you
24:59 will push you upwards it will Propel you
24:02 further after that
24:10 then comes the concept of the clouds
24:13 that you will see very close by
24:16 as you come up there are two layers of
24:18 clouds that you will see close by then
24:28 you will cross the moon you'll have to
25:31 circumvent the moon and then the jivatma
25:34 has to go I told you yesterday this
25:36 desam is called into desham because moon
25:39 is very very important for us as much as
25:42 the sun people think sun is important
25:44 moon is as important as the sun
25:12 the one who is responsible for the
25:15 clouds there then you will cause Brahma
25:17 and then after that there will be
25:19 Darkness
25:21 sir it is very dark is there any other
25:24 way two lines in purusha suktam tells
25:26 that there is no other way
26:34 there is no other way there is no other
26:36 way sir then there is Darkness who will
26:39 guide that is when comes
26:50 after you cross the world called as
26:54 vidyut means lightning shastram tells it
26:57 there will be a light boundary not the
26:00 way we perceive boundary today China
26:02 India border not that way there will be
26:05 a thin boundary after which the Jiva
26:08 Atma will become like a person living in
26:12 vaikundam it is called
26:19 so it will become like
26:21 because there is no return for it no
26:23 rebirth then comes the last name
26:26 the one who allows the riches of that
27:31 lokam when I say riches
27:32 see for our understanding shastram will
27:35 say you will get sandal to grind for the
27:37 Lord no you should not think they'll be
27:39 one rule there they'll be one Sandalwood
27:42 whatever is
27:44 a quality of
27:48 Earth to that will be us
27:50 we will be very close to parabraham
27:53 we'll just be like him but won't be him
27:57 you're getting the point you know uh in
27:60 the word Maya they are in the Saraswati
27:02 used to State very beautifully what does
27:04 Maya mean as though it is there so
27:08 similarly Visa you will become very
27:10 close to the Lord
27:12 many qualities you'll share but you will
27:15 not be him you will be with him but not
27:18 him
27:19 so this state is reached that is the
27:21 answer to the question number two
28:00 for the entire creation
28:04 right from the start
28:17 so he is the one who has created you hey
28:22 the answer to your six questions as to
28:26 who is the one who is to be propitiated
28:29 who is that one whom we have to attain
29:33 who is that one who has to be done
29:35 archana of he who is that one who is to
29:38 be done stuti off who is the Dharma of
29:42 all dharmas who is the one who is the
29:44 paramam Japan the answer is one the one
29:47 who's standing next to you called
29:49 Krishna is the answer for all these
29:53 questions
29:11 in many many ways is the Panacea to our
29:15 understanding and the worldly sufferings
29:18 one important point which I thought I
29:21 have to highlight
29:23 for nama
29:26 in the last 30 40 years something that
29:29 has caught up a lot of attention among
30:32 asthikas
30:34 bhagavatamas both in tamilnadu Kerala
30:37 Karnataka Andhra and many places in the
30:40 north is
30:43 correct
30:44 so if you go to many temples of the
30:46 Gautier sampradayam
30:48 if you go to many temples of
30:50 vaishnavasampradayam smart they'll tell
30:52 you recite the Nama of the Lord
30:55 there is something called
30:57 in tamilnadu if you've heard of it David
30:60 Trinity
30:04 you have both
30:07 they were all people who venerated
30:11 today for
30:15 I'm not exaggerating
31:35 begins and everybody is completely
31:38 engrossed in that
31:39 in the Gap whenever
31:43 people talk
31:45 many of them say you keep telling the
31:48 Nama of the Lord narayana
31:51 you'll get moksham
31:53 this is where technically they get it
31:57 wrong
31:60 alone cannot Grant moksham as per
31:03 upanishads
31:07 can can I just explain these two lines
31:09 better
31:11 Harris
31:22 beautiful
31:24 but to tell that
31:27 itself will grant Moksha may be
31:29 technically wrong I'm not saying it will
32:31 not
32:32 how well
32:34 understand this vedantic statement it
32:37 will help you in any way wherever you go
32:40 vedanta is very clear it says to attain
32:44 moksham the only way is knowledge
32:51 you'll get Moksha
32:54 now comes the question what is nyanam
32:57 see I know the lanthanides and actinides
32:00 in mendeleev's periodic table that is
32:03 also gyanam
32:05 I know the lapital rule in
32:07 differentiation that is also gyanam
32:10 I know air pollination and water
32:12 pollination in botany that is also
32:15 gyanam
32:16 I know OVI Paris and Vivi Paris and OVO
32:19 Vivi Paris in Zoology that is also
32:21 gyanam
32:23 I know about the black Battle of Plassey
32:26 and the first world war second world war
32:28 quit India movement the great parampara
33:30 like vihasa Maharishi called
33:42 I know the entire parampara so that is
33:45 also gyanam anything is knowledge
33:48 anything is knowledge
33:50 but vedanta says it doesn't say what
33:54 nyana
33:55 so anybody can interpret saying I have
33:57 geography and I'm history will that give
33:59 me Moksha
33:02 if you know any subject in detail
33:04 knowing getting into that will also
33:06 force you to commit moksham
33:10 right but
33:13 is this nyanam no
33:17 no
33:18 as you keep doing it see today I don't
33:21 know what is the meaning of the word
33:23 Rama I don't know what is the word of
33:26 the meaning of the word Krishna I don't
33:28 know what is the meaning of the word
33:29 Hare
34:31 some good mahanubhava has taught me this
34:33 Mantra this particular
34:36 panchakshari I keep reciting it
34:39 as I keep reciting it whenever I have
34:42 time not with devotion just like that
34:46 one day
34:48 the namum is so powerful that it will me
34:52 it will put me across to the right
34:54 person
34:55 I will just be walking by the Zara shop
34:59 in Orion Mall
34:02 as I'm walking one person will come

35:06 rupees so what I'll buy that 30 rupees
35:08 that also I'll barking
35:10 one one rates are 25 rupees
35:14 for publishing that book itself you
35:15 would have spent 30 rupees but you know
35:17 that five rupees if we bargain and get
35:19 we feel we have achieved
35:22 so we'll bargain we'll bargain with that
35:24 person we would have spent seven
35:26 thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
35:28 for a toned jeans in Zara
36:33 is not as precious as the tone jeans
36:37 25 rupees only I can pay I got that book
36:40 I'll keep it in my house
36:43 that has gone into some Shelf
36:45 three weeks later
36:48 the residence of that house decide to
36:50 clean that house many of them don't do
36:52 it every day
36:54 so they decide to clean the house so as
36:57 I clean the house I get this book then I
36:59 remember oh that day I got so I tried to
36:03 dust that book as I dust that book the
36:06 pages go left to right in one page I see
36:09 two words by the site Nama sankirtanam
36:12 helps
36:13 something interesting I'll keep that
36:15 book aside that afternoon while having
36:17 green tea dietitian has said
36:20 I will open that book
36:23 as I read page after page I get the
36:26 inquisitiveness to know more
36:29 I started while I am zero now I have
37:32 reached 0.1
37:34 that evening one of my relatives is
37:37 coming
37:39 I we have made good snacks for them
37:41 after giving those nice snacks we tell
37:44 them please stay for dinner also no no
37:46 no no
37:48 there is one upanyasam happening close
37:50 by
37:51 they are talking about how Nama
37:53 sankirtanam leads us to bhakti which
37:56 will lead to nyanam which will lead to
37:58 moksham
37:59 is it
37:01 even I read something about like that
37:03 now is the person good okay
37:06 he will talk about a lot of things
37:09 and will finally arrive at the topic not
37:12 bad
37:13 if you are free you can come
37:16 is the event free who discourses are
37:19 always free
37:21 you can come
37:23 okay fine I'll come I'll go
37:27 out of two hours I may not be able to
37:30 relate to the entire two hours but 10
38:32 minutes will make little difference in
38:34 me
38:35 maybe Vishnu sahasranamam has something
38:37 in it
38:39 tomorrow I should buy one good Vishnu
38:41 sahasranama book from exotic
38:43 indiamart.com
38:45 I want to read about that more if free
38:48 Nama has a meaning to it
38:50 as you read
38:53 you internalize the content and as you
38:56 internalize you realize
38:59 as you realize you get nyanam and
38:03 through that gyanam you get Moksha but
38:05 where did it begin
38:09 so technically to say that
38:11 namasankitanam is granted moksham is one
38:14 way right but the Nyan is namasankitanam
38:17 has led into bhakti which led into
38:19 gyanam which granted Moksha
38:22 so whatever I speak or whatever you
38:26 listen is not something we have planned
38:29 completely
39:34 I was ordained to speak about Vishnu
39:37 sahasranamam in my karma these two days
39:41 Without You realizing it in your karma
39:44 it is written that you have to listen to
39:46 sahasranamam for two days
39:49 that is why in such a city of over one
39:53 and a half crore population
39:56 a select few have come from different
39:59 corners of the city and that one thing
39:01 that is binding us is the knowledge of
39:03 sahasranama
39:06 right
39:08 helps that aids in bhakti which grants
39:13 the knowledge and knowledge gives Moksha
39:18 but for that you need small means like
39:21 Nama sankirtanam carnatic music dance
39:26 today somehow The Narrative has been
39:29 hijacked
40:31 music you know you don't have to believe
40:34 in sanatana Dharma music is something
40:37 different so the musicians themselves
40:39 say what are you say I'm not singing for
40:41 tiagara Raja I'm not singing first I am
40:43 singing for kamboji who's kamboji
40:47 you know kalyani just gives me that high
40:50 what high will kalyani give unless and
40:52 until it is
40:17 uh
40:18 pancakes
41:34 In classical music
41:37 agree with these musicians when they say
41:39 I don't believe in they are singing
41:42 compositions and then they say I don't
41:44 believe in why do you want to see don't
41:47 sing sing about toothpaste
41:50 you can sing about toothpaste also in
41:52 kalyani do that let people buy tickets
41:54 and come why do you want to sing the
41:56 compositions of tiagara Raja agree we
41:59 may not have the same Raja he was at a
41:03 different level we are at a different
41:04 level at least you should respect that
41:07 musician and say that you are aspiring
41:09 to be as devoted as tyagaraja no no I
41:12 don't believe in
41:13 I believe in kamboji who is this
41:16 kambooji
41:18 so art forms have been hijacked today
41:21 which is wrong
41:23 all these composed out of sheer devotion
41:27 if you feel that you cannot sing out of
42:30 devotion you are unfit for this
42:32 profession go do something else
42:40 is meant to propitiate God
42:46 we want to awaken people about
42:50 don't cut trees
42:52 cutting trees is wrong your thought is
42:55 good but cutting tree don't cut trees
42:59 message should be a small part of your
42:01 dance
42:03 cutting how not to cut trees that is the
42:05 name of unto our dance production will
42:07 bharata Muni agree with you
42:10 bringing awareness amongst the people
42:12 about nature is very important through
42:15 art forms but make it a part of your
42:18 bhakti
42:19 don't make don't cut trees alone one
42:21 dance
42:25 we have to gain back our roots of
42:27 understanding sanatana Dharma slowly you
43:30 know people have detached music from
43:32 sanatana Dharma that is an art form what
43:34 form
43:36 which civilization allows people to Sing
43:39 About God there are many civilizations
43:41 that think that singing itself is a
43:43 crime
43:44 in sanatana Dharma you can attain God
43:48 through music
43:50 you can attain God through dance when a
43:53 civilization gives us the liberty to
43:56 attain the Supreme through various ways
43:58 we should learn how to respect that
43:01 Civilization it's very important
43:05 Dharma has sustained itself after so
43:09 many invasions in so many ridicules and
43:12 so many onslaughts
43:14 because of the love that binds the
43:16 follower to the religion not fear
43:21 we are never fear of fearful of sanatana
43:23 Dharma there is no one single Authority
43:25 who will issue that sentence to us today
43:27 nor the single person
44:30 we are bound by love
44:32 and it is only that bhakti which is love
44:35 which is sustaining sanatana Dharma
44:38 so my Earnest request of course there
44:41 are elderly people here you have all
44:42 been sustaining sanatana Dharma to the
44:44 Gen Z
44:47 and to the millennials
44:50 you don't have to publicly state that I
44:54 am bhaktiman I'm doing this I'm doing
44:56 that no all that is not required bhakti
44:58 is a very personal element
44:01 but inculcate that bhakti how will you
44:04 do that listen to lectures listen to
44:06 music
44:10 of course you can watch a pony in Sylvan
44:13 but remember that the punning selvan
44:15 truly called arul muri verman or
44:18 rajaraja cholan with so much of
44:22 Aura around him as being one of the most
44:24 powerful
44:25 Kings
44:27 as one of the most powerful naval fleets
44:30 he called himself the servant of Shiva
45:32 called shivapada sheikhara
45:34 in all his inscriptions he says I'm a
45:36 devotee of Shiva
45:38 the best of the Kings always treated
45:41 themselves as the Servants of God
45:43 marthandavarma he says
45:46 I am servant to padmanabha
45:49 because with highest power comes the
45:52 biggest humility
45:55 all our kings are humble so bhakti is
45:59 something that you don't have to
45:00 Showcase in the public
45:02 but you would have to inculcate within
45:04 yourself
45:05 try as many sources to equip this
45:08 knowledge yourself with knowledge we
45:10 don't know whether we'll go to moksham
45:11 or there'll be a next janma correct
45:14 in this janma we are blessed to at least
45:17 know that there is a ramayanam and
45:18 Mahabharata read it sir it is a story
45:21 known every time I'm I don't even have a
45:24 count of how many bhagavataams have done
45:27 set of seven days I would have done at
45:29 least 100 plus
46:30 every time trust me every time I glance
46:34 through bhagavatam to present it during
46:36 that time
46:38 I will realize who
46:39 this why didn't I know that before
46:42 itself how did I know that now
46:44 every time I touch bhagavatam it gives
46:47 me a new thought
46:48 that powerful is shuka's words and that
46:51 powerful is valmiki's kokilam
46:54 so rather than immersing ourselves into
46:57 other books other books are fine the
46:59 deception point is good
46:01 DaVinci talks about Mary Magdalene
46:03 Angels and Demons talks about anagrams
46:06 all that is good and interesting but in
46:09 my humble opinion I don't want you all
46:12 to completely endorse what I feel but I
46:14 feel since I have been given the stage
46:16 in the mic I can tell with sheer
46:18 confidence
46:20 no scripture in this world comes even
46:24 closer to ramayana and Mahabharata the
46:26 way it is presented
46:29 I am not talking because I belong to
47:31 sanatana Dharma maybe you can assume
47:34 you're free to assume it's a democratic
47:36 country but
47:38 the way in which it has been presented
47:40 the human thoughts the mesh of human
47:44 politics that goes into these books the
47:47 philosophy that is extracted from its
47:49 surrenderings is unparalleled and
47:52 unsurpassed in many many ways
47:55 of course to protect such scriptures
47:58 we need organizations like bharati Vidya
47:02 Bhavan it it calls itself bharatiya
47:07 there are so many institutes that want
47:09 to call them with the anglic name India
47:11 Indian Institute Indian
47:14 but this is called by its original name
47:16 bharatiya
47:18 and what is associated with bharata
47:20 knowledge Vidya
47:23 and where is the Temple of that Vidya
47:26 the entire country which is the Bhavan
47:28 Bhavan is the place where it is housed
48:30 so bharati Vidya Bhavan
48:33 has been one of the torchbearers of The
48:37 Vedic civilization which we are all an
48:39 integral part of
48:42 I am extremely indebted to bharatiya
48:44 Vidya Bhavan to allow me to speak for
48:47 two days on a topic like this
48:53 commentary alongside philosophy is not
48:56 something that a general audience can
48:58 enjoy relish and take home
48:01 Rama item is easy
48:02 I can give narration
48:11 I didn't do that I can get as
48:14 interesting in my narration but how long
48:17 will narrations keep hold of our
48:19 audience shouldn't we get one step
48:21 deeper and understand the philosophy
48:24 for that
48:26 BBB has given me this stage
48:29 the entire team of BBB
49:32 the astikas who have supported it the
49:36 sponsors badri Vishal
49:38 and all of you
49:40 see we don't we have never kept Banner
49:43 even in any of the temples I don't know
49:45 how many temples we have no banners just
49:47 a word of mouth can pull people on a
49:50 Sunday morning which is supposed to be
49:52 the laziest of the them all
49:54 on a Sunday morning to a lecture on
49:56 Vishnu sahasranamam just proves that
49:59 Bangalore can be called the I.T Capital
49:02 the biotech Capital flooding capital
49:05 but I would beg to differ
49:08 in the day because I travel everywhere I
49:11 see a transition in Bangalore in the
49:13 last seven eight years
49:15 very soon it will become the spiritual
49:17 capital
49:19 the way I see it
49:24 so kudos to all the asthikas
49:26 irrespective of each little children
49:30 which is which was a rarity in those
50:32 days
50:33 now I see a huge change in the trend
50:36 people below the age of 45 constitute
50:39 over 50 percent of my audience today
50:42 which just proves that age has nothing
50:44 to do with narration and civilization
50:47 it's it's in fact your interest in your
50:50 love that binds us all together
50:52 with this two announcements November
50:55 25th domlur Tamil upanyasam they wanted
50:58 it in Tamil if you can't understand
50:60 Tamil you can still understand if you
50:02 have the will to learn a language
50:05 if you want the content learn the
50:07 language
50:08 second
50:09 it is in the evening maybe around 5 36
50:12 at Surya Nara in a Swami Temple mantapam
50:16 domlur November 25th I think it's a
50:19 Friday I think

50:24 of it
