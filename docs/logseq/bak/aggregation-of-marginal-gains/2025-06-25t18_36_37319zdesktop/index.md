# aggregation of marginal gains

[Atomic Habits](logseq/bak/highlights/books/atomic-habits/2025-06-25t18_36_37332zdesktop/)


- Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the [aggregation of marginal gains](logseq/bak/aggregation-of-marginal-gains/2024-10-05t08_51_53362zdesktop/),” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. (Location 232)
  - **Note:** Aggregational marginal change
- Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” (Location 235)
  - **Note:** [One percent rule](logseq/bak/one-percent-rule/2025-06-25t18_36_37315zdesktop/)
