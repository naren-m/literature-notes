# Dharma


- ధార యతి, ఇతి ధర్మ:
- ధ్రియథేవ జనయరితి ధర్మ:


One that sustains. What does it sustain? Balance in the creation.

Rita - Righteousness in thought
Satya - Righteousness in speech
Dharma - Righteousness in actions

[Hanuman Chalisa](sanskrit-lit/hanuman-chalisa/)
sankata te hanumāna chhudāvai।
mana krama vachana dhyāna jo lāvai॥ 26 ॥
