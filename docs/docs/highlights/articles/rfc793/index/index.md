### Highlights

- TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to
  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network
  applications. The TCP provides for reliable inter-process
  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to
  distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.
- TCP assumes it can obtain a simple,
  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level
  protocols.
