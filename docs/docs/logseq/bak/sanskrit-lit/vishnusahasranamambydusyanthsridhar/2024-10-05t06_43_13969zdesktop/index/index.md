  ### Transcript

  [Part 7/8 | Vishnu Sahasranama Vaibhavam | ENGLISH | Dushyanth Sridhar | The Six Questions & Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49xUHEHrHk)

  00:00:00 the blessings of bhumi Devi and mahalakshmi so she was called bhuma so he brought up this girl bhuma with so much of love and this girl of four or five years took up to cooking because her father was always engaged in austerity somebody had to cook so she started cooking one day an aged person in a few days from then he will die that kind of an aged person he walked towards the Hermitage of Mark and dear Maharishi and said markandeya I need to find a good braid markandeya asked for your grandson no no

  00:00:43 for me Mark India did not know what to reply to this old man he was one foot on the grave but he was worried that that man will end up cursing him so he said why have you approached me sir I heard that you have a little girl in your house so she's a little girl call her ask her whether she is in agreement to Marry Me Marry Me sir she she doesn't know what proportion of salt is to be added to food don't worry my doctor is also advised have less salt I will not have salt from now on call your daughter the daughter came

  00:01:25 Mark and day I thought the daughter will reject him outright she said if at all have to marry I'll marry only him what do you find attractive in this man to that girl alone that old man appeared as a young man he was none but the Lord himself so he said I choose to be a person whose abstained from Salt throughout my life but then she said don't call yourself like by these names what is your husband's name saltless man if somebody asks what is your husband's name Mr saltless I will give you one definition the wife

  00:02:08 said the one who has no match why because he is the one and the only one the one God so he says whom should I reach there so in upayam itself remember this in upayam itself the questions are split into two foreign [Music] that which is the that who is the final one to be attained and that one who has to be attained where comes the next questions means is Abode what is the Abode of narayana it is called srivaikundam or paramapadam that is what is mentioned now before getting to this one general question I will ask who is a nastika

  00:03:15 huh who does not believe in God you agree huh very good the one who doesn't believe in Vedas is called nastika remember this if you have to answer technically in sanatana Dharma you if they ask you who is an atheist you give that definition one who believes in no God asthika means one who says vedam is there the one who doesn't believe that Vedas are not true is called nastika okay now coming to the point suggests whom I have to attain Ed where I have to attain that was the second now these two questions are related to

  00:04:07 upayam come to question number three four five six upayam student come whom should I do stuti off whom should I do archana off upon which manavas like us will Attain auspiciousness fifth question in your opinion which is the Dharma the best of all dharmas [Music] of whom one can get rid of this worldly material bondage these are the six questions question number one and two is about upayam question number three four five six is about upayam now I am going to divide the four questions further into

  00:05:17 three categories question number three and four is about siddha upayam question number five is about sadhya upayam question number six is about Salam banopayam early morning you are this lecture is between our mouth and bisibility see in school days early morning if you have a history session after lunch break if you have grammar class equivalent to that is Vishnu sahasranamam class on a Sunday morning but I can't help he has commented that we go ask bhishma why question number three and four is about

  00:06:11 what is siddha siddha means that which is ready siddham means ready see if somebody asks sir we have to leave for the lecture are you ready I am siddham means I am ready siddha upayam is the Lord himself because he is the one who's always ready this is question number five question number six which is Japan Japan through which of the Japanese can we attain him so the six questions are ready question number one and two is about upayam question number three four five six is about upayam question number

  00:06:59 three and four about are about siddha upayam question number five question number six now question number three and four are divided further which is Lagu City question number four is and when that answer comes we'll explain now bhishma acharya thought first of all he liked yudhisthira and he liked his questions see generally when there is a question answered session in most of the other places one of the easiest ways to keep the person who's asking the question quiet is to give that remark your

  00:07:43 question is good good question sir it will be a waste question but if we tell that only he will be happy and he will sit ES so but here yudhisthira tells asks genuine questions and bhishma charya tells but he says I will give answer in my own way you should give the Liberty to the person right that is when he starts telling the answer I will tell you what is the answer for every question you'll have to map that he starts answering for the sixth question first he says I'll answer the sixth question

  00:08:27 first [Music] um so this is the answer to the sixth question Kim Japan so he says the one who is not bound by space and time purus who is Prabhu Kalyan Jewelers [Music] see how do we dis derive at the word purushottama I will tell you how the word comes anybody with the name purushottama here anybody who knows somebody with the name purushotama here are very good so you go and tell them what their name means they have a wonderful name whether they are like that or not the name is wonderful there are three tatvas in vedanta

  00:09:30 ishwara achit means that which is not substratum to knowledge that which doesn't give space to knowledge is called that which gives space to knowledge is called chit jivatma is called chit the one who controls achit and chit is called ishwara okay this chith is divided into three we are all bound by Karma so we are called badhatma if at all we attain moksham we will get green card now we are H1B Visa holders once we get green card we'll become muktatma the original people who are staying in vaikuntam above origins or the natural

  00:10:15 native people are called as nithyatma so divatma is divided into badhatma muktatma nithyatma you you sir wait it'll get easy don't worry so there are five ishwara is called purusha purushaha is different from so he is called utpurusha he is different from badatma he's called uttara purusha then he is called uttama purusha purusha uttara purusha uttama purusha since he is different from every tatva found in this world he is called uttama Tama in samskirta means EST we say right tallest EST that is

  00:11:11 the best amongst purushas so what was the answer has okay for this the name corresponding to this in sahasranamam is the Nama 685 it is called have you heard of this what does Tava priyaha means the one who loves being celebrated in any way the devotee celebrates he is which means whatever mistakes we do in the aradhanam we should try avoiding but you don't have to worry because many people say you know in today's Puja I offered the tulasi first and then later what will happen nothing will happen

  00:12:20 first of all discard fear when you reach the Lord he is more merciful and lovable than your own parents even your parents may have disagreements with you but the Lord will never have any disagreement with you so in the last 100 years we have done lot of damage to sanatana Dharma if God does harm to his devotees he's not God remember this he is greater than our mother why will he harm us so when you are doing Puja or aradhanam however simple or however humble it is do it with love do not do it with fear

  00:13:07 is there a way that God is benevolent can you give an example I'll give you an example from charitra even today there is an utsavam called in all the vaishnava temples you know what they will do in front of the deity the Mula deity they will put a huge waste dhoti and they will make many many vegetables together they will make one visibility bath and put it in front of him it is called kadambasadam then the entire town that day they won't cook they will come with their the bus they will take the prasadam and go

  00:13:50 so thousand years before this ceremony had to happen in Sri rangam this utsavam got ready vegetables were being cut Nick day two this utsavam was supposed to happen and on that day too when this utsavam happens where before Lord SRI ranganatha the the cooked rice is kept in front of him on that day the reigning preceptor of that region acharya has to come in front of the Lord and then the priest will say yeah he will say oh acharya come here the acharya has to receive the tirtham of the Lord first and as soon as he

  00:14:26 receives the other devotees will receive and the prasadam will be distributed amongst the devotees this is the procedure on day one the previous day ramanuja went on a Expedition he went city after City Village after Village and he was returning to srirangam so while returning to srirangam from the northern part of srirangam he had to cross the tributary to kaveri called as kolidam generally collidum is not a tributary where there is lot of water you have to walk on their signs and come towards the corner where there was wet

  00:15:16 sand he saw a group of four or five children seated and playing he was wondering what are they playing on these wet Sands he went closer he saw that these children maybe of four years five years six years seven years they had made a replica of srirangam Temple with that wet sand and inside that sanctum sanctorum the replica was this small in that there was a Garba gram and inside that they had kept one small bamboo stick in the place of ranganatha and opposite that bamboo stick they had made small cups which were akin to the

  00:15:54 silver cups that you have in the sanity and kaveri water was kept in those small tiny cups and one of the students thought that he is the priest and the other student has to be ramanuja so the other student who was of five years age he was holding three sticks together tiridandi sannyasi so this boy priest said he had made taken some sand and kept it in front of that bamboo who is akin to ranganatha and that sand was busy bele bath so this boy who's the priest like how it would happen on day two

  00:16:35 where when the priest says Dr ramanuja has to come he said yeah the other boy who's ramanuja comes in front I am here and that boy the priest boy had to give that little water because they are enacting what would happen the next day but to their surprise when that little boy said yeah who was witnessing this from a distance came running and he put his palm in the front this boy was surprised how is my friend's Palm so big he looked this side he found that gigantic personality of ramanja he did not know what to react this boy of four

  00:17:14 or five years to that man of over 80 or 90 years said please give me that water he took that little Cup made out of kaveri sand and put poured that water into ramanuja's Palm was supposed to happen tomorrow has happened today stop the utsavam tomorrow the CC has asked why I could see ranganatha in that little mantapam with the child has made ranganatha is not just in that sanctum sanctorum he is in that little stick what this little boy has made because he is tawa priyaha whatever you call him he will accept

  00:18:02 that you know andal the Mystic poetess she tells that you all think there are only thousand names of Vishnu and sahasranamam correct thousand names she says there's a thousand oneth name generally when people give gifts for functions they will always make the thousand one hundred and one what is the Thousand oneth name andal tells the one who does not know the pain or the agony what women have that is his thousandth name what is this thousand one's name the one who doesn't know the agony of women that is a thousand one

  00:18:37 thing the Lord says if andal gives me that I will accept that also great so that is the answer to the sixth question answer to the sixth question what is the sixth question okay now let us go to the question number four what was the question number four question number four was so whom should I do archana of what is who is archana she is a singer who is archana my granddaughter archana what does archana mean you go to a temple sir 50 rupees yesterday they'll give one ticket you will go there hey Winger Gotham

  00:19:39 okay then he'll go the priest will go inside we will be absolutely disconnected to what he's saying he will make sure that he is not audible outside huh from this place he will start he'll go inside then how will you know he has completed the last two namas will have one tone um you'll take the 10 rupee coin because nobody accepts 10 rupee coins who will accept only the Lord will accept you will take the 10 rupee coin and archana is done this is the archana's tone antenna today but what is archana for

  00:20:34 eign that's all see we should not assume what we get as praises to be true I would have I would have forgotten two slokas your name I should not take that seriously I should take it in that too but the Lord is absolutely conversant and eligible for receiving our praises but how do we go and praise him we are not that Adept see neither do we know sastram in detail nor can we remember our itihasas and puranas called UPA brahmanam in detail that is why our rishis who are very generous kind and benevolent have themselves created those

  00:21:33 set pattern of praises the one who is the one who has created that is the one who is knowledge herself the one who thinks good for all the creatures in her creation the one who is a personification of utmost devotion the one who accompanies Agni during all The Vedic injunctions the one who accompanies all Vedic aphorisms that attract the pitrus it is called swada the one who is the better half to the Lord the one who is present in the eloquence of a person the one who is Seated on the Lotus whose

  00:22:43 petals give only Radiance and exuberance [Music] the one who is as wit and merciful as the Lotus which blossoms with the connection of the Serene Waters of a pond this is what archanais so our rishis have created this pattern and they have said when you go to a temple you may not be Adept enough to sing at least listen to that Chana that listen word is only a problem for us correct so two things are meant to make any archana successful one the person who is wanting to do archana should listen the one who is doing archana should be

  00:23:28 sincere when you go to a temple now from now on you make it a point you are paying for an archana listen to it and if there is a priest who's listening to it let them do it sincerely you may be wondering sir poor thing how many times he'll be doing he has taken up that as his job Dharma he has to do it so what is the fourth question whom should I do archana off foreign ask six questions when answer was the same you're getting my point for all the answers you know what bhishma tells it is the same narayana

  00:24:25 who to whom archana has to be done it is the same archana who is the only God it is the same narayana who's the Dharma is to get one answer why should you ask six questions because in the Loki Ka pattern in our mundane pattern we have different Ministries allotted mahalakshmi means she will give gold tomorrow if you have fever she has not studied medicine that is our understanding if you go to Hayek griva he will give you knowledge tomorrow if you want money no no no he is not concerned with Finance no credit risk no Market risk he

  00:25:05 doesn't know all that this is our way of understanding sanatana Dharma understand this way if narayana can grant moksham he can also grant us 10 Rupees correct so the one who grants moksham is adept of granting us knowledge material pleasures and so on how do we know that in Sri bhagavad-gita you have the shloka what Krishna tells again this is a very important shloka Gita is something that you you know some people say what are you doing these days I'm reading Gita I have to fall at their feet because when you read Gita if there is

  00:25:45 someone who can understand Gita by just reading they are to be celebrated at the level of ADI shankara and ramanuja because in my humble opinion you can never understand Gita by taking the book of Gita it's very tough it's everywhere the shloka will be said karma Arjuna do your duty don't expect the fruits is it really something that you believe in your child studies to go to Berkeley or Harvard see you study don't do it with the aim of going to Berkeley or Harvard how will you say this so first of all our understanding

  00:26:26 of Gita itself is wrong if Gita was so simple would have not commented at all so you need someone to explain now let me take this loka have you heard of the slokamam um four classes of people propitiate me they do it to get good deeds who are they asked Arjuna are Taha jignas four categories of people he says what does artha mean very good the one who is in distress if you are in pain you're called artha RT means the one who is suffering sir I thought it was aarti that is harthi ha h a that is means you are giving distress to Ganga

  00:27:52 in sanskritam aarti is not arti that is should come trouble foreign it is better you stick to giving names to your grandchildren from the Lakshmi ashtotram don't try something new you'll end up giving names which don't mean actually right the one who is in distress correct but there is an other meaning to our remember this the one who has lost wealth but gains it back is called so suppose you have lost your cell phone sir don't even say that sir our Atma is inside that you know in those days the demon will not have the Atma in him

  00:28:47 the Atma will be inside a parrot the parrot will be in a cage that cage will be in a cave that cave will be in an island that Island will be far away so our hero will go take the boat get inside that cave win all the odds kill that parrot then the demon will die is in our cell phone right just assume your cell phone is lost for a minute 21 passwords have been saved in that four gate payment gateways are there in it inside that in when the flap cover you will find those credit cards your aadhar your adharam is

  00:29:28 there that is lost you are extremely depressed worried next day well you are worried you 've been sharing this Agony with everybody whom you know somebody knocks at your door is this your phone I found it at the end of Brigade Road lying I saw your address and I brought it so you had wealth you lost it and you have gained it you are called our Taha arthriti means the one who has never had wealth but is gaining for the first time so both of them are associated with wealth he had wealth he lost it he

  00:30:15 gained it he gets New Wealth put together they are called Aishwarya there is another person called means the one who wants wants to know more about his jivatma that person is called last comes the category where the person wants to know about the Lord he is called bhagavalla bharti or gyani so Krishna tells Arjuna there are four categories of people Arjuna are Taha and together are Aishwarya wants to understand me all people seek asylum in me thereby there is no Ministry allocation in sanatana Dharma

  00:31:08 Lakshmi will take care of Finance she is nirmala Mommy there is who will take care of army he is rajnath vishwakarma will take care of Roads he's got Curry in fact sanatana Dharma is like the current pmo everything will be taken care only by him so the question is answer is what is the example to that you have to do archana to him archana to whom archana to the one who listens to us see you think we are listening to the Lord impossible we can never listen to the Lord because we have the Habit to never listen to

  00:32:20 anybody so if at all somebody has to bend the door the Lord has to bend he listens to us agree with it yes I will read out the nama 627th nama foreign [Music] see some of you may be wondering sir we thought a lecture like this will be very engaging very simple you are quoting Sanskrit lines see lectures cannot be as simple as the way we think now that the father commands you I cannot keep saying all these sentences okay this is how my lectures are I will read out from the pramana is the one who listens to his devotees

  00:33:40 does he listen to his devotees sir yes I will give you two examples three examples for this one this is a ketram which is found reference even in the sangam literature of the ancient Tamil land it is called see certain names if you are not a Tamil origin speaking person you have to learn these namas no other go if you want to learn more about sanatana Dharma language should not be your barrier so how do we go to this it is next to SM silks and babusha in kanchipuram you can buy one korvai mountain border sarri

  00:34:25 and if you have time you can visit the Lord he is not that important okay it is the Lord is called yet in sanskritam why because there is a charitram to this the Lord was reclining there he's called Vega setu the other name is Vega setu he was the bridge to the river called vegavati he was the first encroachment which the bbmp never cleared he lay laid on the river called vegavati he slept he did not want the river to destroy brahma's yagam in the same shetram was a Mystic saint called as thiru Marissa piran

  00:35:07 this saint was extremely devoted to the Lord and always engaged in deep penance he was served by a student called Kani kannan and another lady who used to come and sweep his ashram May after many many months out of sheer deep Penance this Rishi opened his eyes piran opened his eyes the moment he opened his eyes the lady who was standing in front and doing she was a very old lady she was sweeping she turned into a 16 year old young woman 16 year old girl since she was in tamilnadu she was singing sindura

  00:35:52 she has reached 16 sure she started singing that song by the rishi's grace she became a young woman and she started walking by the streets of kanchipuram the pallavaraja who ruled that time was amazed to see this beautiful lady a personification of blemishless beauty he asked I have never seen you in kanchipuram where are you from the king gust he said I was always in kanchipuram but I have turned young because of this great saint called as thirumarishi piran's eye glances that fell on me now this King said even I am getting old

  00:36:29 I have been trying to do so many anti-wrinkle treatments L'Oreal has not been that helpful this upping there is one upping treatment you have to take and you have to do this um pap smear and you will get nice skinny little it will grow you will be competing with the Lord and his Beauty so with all this technology this King said even I should become beautiful let him look at me also he said see he is not in the profession of looking at people you stand in a queue he'll keep looking at you he just like that he opened his

  00:37:13 eyes it fell on me I turned don't do all this with him he called the king called summoned the Rishi student called kanikandan come here ask your Guru to come to my court and ask him to look at me you wouldn't said sir my Guru is not such a cheap person he is completely into Bhagavad bhakti he will not come if you are not listening to the words that I have commanded it is better that he quit this particular City you don't have to live in my jurisdiction as you come answer he went to his teacher Swami acharya the King has asked me to

  00:37:57 leave the city I'm leaving after the student left for a moment the acharya thought the people call me a guru my only student has left then how can I call myself a guru are you a teacher yes do you have students no then how are you a teacher if my student has left what job have I as a teacher to stay in this place I even also leave the city he left as he left he saw the Lord of kanchipuram lying on looking with he was looking in a way see your student has left you have left what will I do when I don't have a bhakta like you

  00:38:42 when the Lord showed such eyes of a very very pitiable State the Alvar said my student has gone so am I going oh the Lord with lotus like ice you don't have to stay here take your mat which is the Thousand hooded snake roll it keep it under your armpit and walk along with me the Lord walked along with him then he went and stayed in a village for one night that night he stayed there this pallava Kingdom lost electricity Dirty Water started getting mixed with good water all food grains were affected with ants

  00:39:42 and termites the King was wondering what could have happened then he sensed that something equal to a Calamity has happened he goes to the place where are the Lord and his student infestation he tells please come back I've committed a grave Mistake by sinning against you please come back now the Lord has to follow the law kanikandan left so did the acharya go and then the Lord also followed them back to the original place called now spread your snake mat and sleep yesterday he said take your snake mat

  00:40:23 and walk with me he walked today you spread it and sleep he slept he listens to his devotees so he's called vidhay Atma there is another shetram very close to Chennai called Asura in this there was a Rishi calledra so this Rishi was so devoted that the Lord came in the form of an old man and asked where can I sleep where should I sleep which is the room where I have to sleep then the Rishi said this is the place and as he slept the Rishi realized he was none other than the Lord and he said you have to sleep here permanently so he

  00:41:06 slept there is one anecdote which what is that mean he accepts what his devotee gives whatever you give see even our home cooked food he receives it you you must realize how merciful he is with that so one of the greatest scenes in the vaishnava tradition called used to give an anecdote it seems after krishna's marriage too many was from Maharashtra now he settled in Gujarat so in a bullet train speed he took her from nagpur to jamnagar Gujarat he settled there from sabudana khichdi suddenly she has to have dhokla

  00:41:58 one afternoon as they were talking Krishna had a very upset stomach and he went and vomited rukmani asked what food I had you also had why are you vomiting no no I had something more what is that more see yesterday one of the persons who manages many bovine risks cattle in dwaraka had very very old food and water cooked for the cows the cow is generally very not very fussy in nature whatever he gives is here those cows accepted but yesterday he gave such tail food to the cows that the cow refused to
