# Repudiation

Repudiation is a process in which you cannot prove that a transaction took place between two entities.

- [Repudiation](cse/cryptography/repudiation/): repudiation of activity. Compromise of [NonRepudiation](nonrepudiation/). (Trying to hide who we are)

Repudiation = rejection of a proposal or idea.

A repudiation attack happens when an application or system does not adopt controls to properly track and log usersâ€™ actions, thus permitting malicious manipulation or forging the identification of new actions. This attack can be used to change the authoring information of actions executed by a malicious user in order to log wrong data to log files. Its usage can be extended to general data manipulation in the name of others, in a similar manner as spoofing mail messages. If this attack takes place, the data stored on log files can be considered invalid or misleading.
