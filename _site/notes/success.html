<h2 id="outliers">[[Outliers]]</h2>

<p>says success is not personal, we owe some part of it to parentage and patronage. i agree with that fact. We are previlaged to be born in a family that can afford for our education and we are hard working enought to get to a spot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Achievement is talent plus preparation</em></strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The problem with this view is thatthe careers of the gifted,
        <ul>
          <li>the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and</li>
          <li>the bigger the role preparation seems to play.</li>

    <p>Research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the thing that distinguishes one performer from <strong><em>another is how hard he or she works</em></strong>. That’s it.</li>
      <li>And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else.</li>
      <li>They work much, much harder.</li>

<h2 id="grit">[[Grit]]</h2>

<p>Pete’s idol, basketball coach John Wooden, was fond of saying, “Success is never final; failure is never fatal. It’s courage that counts.” What I wanted to know is how a culture of grit continues not just in the afterglow of success, but in the aftermath of failure. What I wanted to know is how Pete and the Seahawks found the courage to continue. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B010MH9V3W&amp;location=3684">Location 3684</a>)</p>

<h2 id="atomic-habits">[[Atomic Habits]]</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Time magnifies the margin between [[success]] and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. (Location 317)</li>
