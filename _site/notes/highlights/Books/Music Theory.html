<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Scientific theories propose that even reality itself at its tiniest layers is just that – a vibration in the quantum field. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=328">Location 328</a>)</li>
  <li>Waves, in physics, are simply space disturbances that transfer energy. There are two main types of waves we experience in our perceivable surroundings: mechanical and electromagnetic waves. Their main difference is that mechanical waves require the presence of physical matter, like air, through which they can travel. Electromagnetic waves do not require any physical medium – they can travel through the vacuum of space. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=329">Location 329</a>)</li>
  <li>In simplest terms, sound can be defined as mechanical waves produced by a vibrating object that travel through a physical medium, like air, water or solid objects. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=334">Location 334</a>)</li>
  <li>Sound is a physical process, but it is also the perception of the brain that processes those mechanical waves and produces the experience we perceive as ‘sound.’ (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=335">Location 335</a>)</li>
  <li>Physically, it can be said that pitch is any particular frequency of the sound produced by a vibrating object, such as a guitar string. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=346">Location 346</a>)</li>
  <li>when we say that something has a frequency of, say 237 Hz, we call that pitch. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=347">Location 347</a>)</li>
  <li>Pitch is what allows us to distinguish one frequency as higher or lower than another frequency. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=347">Location 347</a>)</li>
  <li>Pitch is directly correlated with the wavelength of a sound. ‘Wavelength,’ as the name implies, determines how wide a wave pulse is. A longer wavelength means there will be fewer pulses or waves in any unit of time, which means that the frequency and the pitch will be lower. Likewise, shorter wavelength =&gt; more pulses in a unit of time =&gt; higher frequency =&gt; higher pitch. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=356">Location 356</a>)</li>
  <li>A note is simply a named specific pitch. In other words, we use notes to name different pitches. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=378">Location 378</a>)</li>
  <li>Two sounds can have different rhythmic values and can sound different overall but if they have the same pitch, they will still be the same note. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=383">Location 383</a>)</li>
  <li>If two sounds that are the same note sound different, then it is said that these two sounds have different timbres. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=384">Location 384</a>)</li>
  <li>A timbre is a sound color or sound quality that comes from different instruments. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=385">Location 385</a>)</li>
  <li>Tone is often synonymous with timbre; (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=388">Location 388</a>)</li>
  <li>On the other hand, in music in general, ‘tone’ is often synonymous with a note; usually when we talk about playing different notes, we would say instead ‘playing different tones.’ (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=389">Location 389</a>)</li>
  <li>In this system, the sharp of one note is considered to be harmonically identical – also called enharmonically equivalent – to the flat of the note above it. In other words, A# is exactly the same note as Bb, C# is the same note as Db, D# as Eb, etc. There are no sharps or flats between B and C, or between E and F. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=413">Location 413</a>)</li>
  <li>notes that don’t have any sharps or flats – all white keys on the piano keyboard – are often called natural notes (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=419">Location 419</a>)</li>
  <li>The distance between any two of these twelve notes that are next to each other is called a half-step (abbreviated: H), and each half-step is the same distance. (For example the distance between A# and B is the same as the distance between E and F.) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=421">Location 421</a>)</li>
  <li>The distance comprising two half-steps, which is the distance between, for instance, C and D, is called a whole step (W). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=423">Location 423</a>)</li>
  <li>In the previous section we mentioned that the term ‘tone’ is sometimes used as a name for a particular music interval. This is that case – oftentimes the term semitone (S) is used instead of the half-step; and tone (T) instead of the whole step. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=424">Location 424</a>)</li>
  <li>We say that the notes are repeated in higher and lower registers. All registers in the audible range (the range our ears can hear) contain the same twelve notes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01JX6EFKW&amp;location=442">Location 442</a>)</li>
