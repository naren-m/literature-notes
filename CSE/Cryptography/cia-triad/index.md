# CIA Triad

CIA Triad is a reference to [confidentiality](docs/cse/cryptography/confidentiality/index/), [integrity](docs/cse/cryptography/integrity/index/), and [availability](docs/cse/cryptography/availability/index/), which are the pillars of security. 


Each is a category of security:
- ## Confidentiality
	- ``{{embed ((67046651-45a7-4880-9369-6c5895d3b254)`)}}`
- ## Integrity
  
  Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.
  
  [Hashing](docs/cse/cryptography/hashing/index/) algorithms are used to confirm integrity.
- ## Availability
  
  Availability means resources and services are available as expected.
  
  Digital signatures, a combination of [Hashing](docs/cse/cryptography/hashing/index/) and [Encryption](docs/cse/cryptography/encryption/index/), can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
