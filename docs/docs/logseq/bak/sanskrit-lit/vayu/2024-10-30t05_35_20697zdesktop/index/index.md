# Vayu

The Sanskrit word Vayu translates as “wind,” and
the root ‘va’ translates to “that which flows.”

Thus a Vayu is an energetic force that moves in a specific direction to control bodily functions and activities.

The ancient yogis found 49 distinct types of Vayus in the body. 

Only five of the main Vayus or *PanchaPranas* [PanchaVayu](logseq/bak/panchavayu/2025-06-25t18_36_37327zdesktop/) are important for yoga practitioners to understand. These five primary currents of vital force are Prana-Vayu, Apana-Vayu, Samana-Vayu, Udana-Vayu, and Vyana-Vayu
