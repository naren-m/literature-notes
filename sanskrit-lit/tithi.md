## How to calculate

What is Tithi and how it is calculated:

The time between two new moons is called 'lunar month' and it is equivalent to about 30 days. There are 30 tithis or lunar days in a lunar month. We can also understand Tithi in such a way that the time it takes for the 'Moon line' to move 12 degrees above the 'Sun line' is called Tithi.

According to Vedic perspective, "Tithi" is very important, as the Universal Time Management and it's relationship with the Earth is through "Tithi". For the devotees, to know Tithi, like Ekadasi, etc is very important.

1. Today is Ekadasi. Today, Sun is in Pieces at 333 degrees, 21 minutes and 48 seconds at 3:30 PM and Moon is in Capricorn at 287 degrees, 51 minutes and 54 seconds.

2. Formula to calculate Tithi = (Lunar Longitude – Solar Longitude) / 12 = {287.858 - 333.364} = {Minus 45.506 + 360}/12 = 26.207.

3. In the formula, to calculate Tithi add 360⁰ if (Lunar Longitude – Solar Longitude) is less than zero or possesses negative value = {Minus 45.506 + 360}/12 = 26.207.
 1. How to find Lunar Longitude and Solar Longitude

5. The final Tithi comes by rounding off (higher value) with the actual calculated value having decimal value.

6. If the number after calculation comes out to be less than 15 then the Tithi is of Bright half (Shukla or Gaur Paksha) otherwise the Tithi is of Dark Half (Krishna Paksha). Deduct 15 from Krishna Paksha value.
Since 26.207 is more than 15, so current Paksh is Krishna Paksh = 26.207 - 15 = 11.207. Rounding of to higher value makes it 12th day or Dwadashi. Since today, Ekadasi was till 11:16 AM. after that Dwadashi started and at 3:30 PM, it is Dwadashi.

6. By multiplying the value which comes after decimal with 100, we get the percentage of Tithi passed at the time of the calculations = {1 - 0.207} = 0.793 X 100 = 79.3 % of Dwadashi Tithi is left at 3:30 PM today.

7. To calculate Nakshatra manually, take only the Sidereal Lunar Longitude in Degrees which in this case is 287.858⁰ and multiply it by 60 and then divide it by 800.

Mathematically, Nakshatra = {(Lunar Sidereal Longitude In Degrees) × 60} ÷ 800

Nakshatra at 3:30 PM of 18th March 2023 = {(287.858) X 60} / 800 = 21.589 or 22nd Nakshatra, which is (Sharvana Nakshatra), in which currently Moon is their.

8. To calculate the Pada of any Nakshatra take the value of that Nakshatra which in this case is 21.589.
Take the decimal side of the value, which in this case is 0.589 and multiply this by 800 = 0.589 × 800 = 471.2.

If this values is within 0 to 200 it is first Pada, within 200 to 400 it is second Pada, within 400 to 600 it is 3rd pada and within 600 to 800 it is 4th pada.

So, current (18th March 2023 at 3:30 PM) Tithi is calculated as Dwadashi (Dark half or Krishna Paksh) and 3rd Pada of Sharvana Nakshatra. Since, today, at Brahma Muhurat it was Ekadashi tithi till 11:16 AM, so, today is Ekadashi Tithi.
