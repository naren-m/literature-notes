Hi,

I love the new look, the arch infront of the house between the pillars is gone and
the door moved to the right place.
It is getting closer to the way we want it to be. Thanks, appreciate it.
Please accomodate the below changes and we will move to the next step.

Below are the changes we would like to request the changes for.
1. Window are too long for our taste. Can you please use large windows
    instead of the ones panning from floor to ceiling.
2. I like the idea of having a window in the place where the door used to be.
    Same comment as the above point, can we have a window but not the floor to ceiling ones.
3. The wooden platform infront of teh entrance, can we extend it to have until the garage wall.
    That is, have the platform infront of the old door as well.
4. Can we curve the pathway to start from the driveway (instead of starting from the curb)
    to the main entrance
