# karma

## Core Concept
Action with the influence of memory - the principle that all actions create impressions that influence future actions and experiences.

## Etymology
From Sanskrit root **कृ (kṛ)** meaning "to do" or "to make"
- कर्म (karma) = action, deed, work
- Related terms: कर्मा (karmā) = doer, कार्य (kārya) = effect

## Historical Development

### Vedic Origins
- **Rig Veda**: Early concept of **Rita** (cosmic order) - actions maintaining universal harmony
- **Brahmanas**: Ritual actions creating cosmic effects
- Connection between sacrificial action and cosmic maintenance

### Upanishadic Evolution  
- **Brihadaranyaka Upanishad** (4.4.5-6): First systematic karma doctrine
  - "One becomes good by good action, bad by bad action"
- **Chandogya Upanishad**: Karma and rebirth connection
- **Katha Upanishad**: Karma affecting consciousness and future births

### Classical Systematization
- **[[Bhagavad Gita]]**: Three types of action clarified
  - Karma (action), Akarma (inaction), Vikarma (wrong action)
- **Yoga Sutras**: Karma as mental impressions ([[chitta]]) affecting consciousness

## Three Classifications of Karma

### 1. Sanchita Karma (संचित कर्म)
- **Accumulated karma** from all past lives
- Vast storehouse of karmic impressions
- Mostly dormant, waiting for appropriate conditions

### 2. Prarabdha Karma (प्रारब्ध कर्म)  
- **Destiny karma** - portion of sanchita activated for current life
- Cannot be changed through current actions
- Determines major life circumstances, body, family

### 3. Kriyamana/Agami Karma (क्रियमाण/आगामि कर्म)
- **Current actions** creating future karma
- Actions performed with full awareness and intention
- Can be modified through conscious choice and spiritual practice

## Cross-School Variations

### Advaita Vedanta
- Karma operates within **Maya** (illusion)
- Liberation transcends karma through Self-realization
- **Adi Shankara**: Karma affects empirical self, not Absolute Self

### Buddhism
- **Dependent Origination** (Pratityasamutpada)
- Karma as intentional action (cetana)
- No permanent self to carry karma - stream of consciousness

### Jainism  
- Karma as subtle **karmic particles** binding to the soul
- Eight types of karma affecting soul's natural qualities
- Physical substance rather than just law

### Yoga Philosophy
- Karma creates **samskaras** (mental impressions) in [[chitta]]
- **Patanjali**: Karma-ashaya (karmic deposit) affecting future births
- Yoga practice purifies karmic impressions

## Modern Interpretations and Research

### Psychological Parallels
- **Behavioral conditioning**: Actions creating habit patterns
- **Cognitive psychology**: Mental schemas affecting perception
- **Neuroplasticity**: Brain changes through repeated actions

### Systems Thinking
- **Feedback loops**: Actions creating consequences affecting future actions  
- **Complex systems**: Small actions having large effects over time
- **Causality research**: Non-linear cause-effect relationships

### Moral Psychology
- **Jonathan Haidt**: Moral intuitions shaped by cultural actions
- **Character development**: Virtuous actions creating virtuous character
- **Social psychology**: Actions affecting group dynamics and individual identity

## Contemporary Applications

### Therapeutic Contexts
- **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction**: Present-moment action awareness
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**: Changing thought-action patterns
- **Positive psychology**: Cultivating beneficial action patterns

### Organizational Behavior
- **Corporate karma**: Organizational actions affecting long-term culture
- **Leadership development**: Actions creating organizational patterns
- **Ethics in business**: Long-term consequences of business decisions

## Related Concepts

- [[Yoga Sutras]] - systematic analysis of karma and consciousness
