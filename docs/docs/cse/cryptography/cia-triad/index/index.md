# CIA Triad

CIA Triad is a reference to [confidentiality](cse/cryptography/confidentiality/), [integrity](cse/cryptography/integrity/), and [availability](cse/cryptography/availability/), which are the pillars of security. 


Each is a category of security:
- ## Confidentiality
	- {{embed ((67046651-45a7-4880-9369-6c5895d3b254))}}
- ## Integrity
  
  Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.
  
  [Hashing](cse/cryptography/hashing/) algorithms are used to confirm integrity.
- ## Availability
  
  Availability means resources and services are available as expected.
  
  Digital signatures, a combination of [Hashing](cse/cryptography/hashing/) and [Encryption](cse/cryptography/encryption/), can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
