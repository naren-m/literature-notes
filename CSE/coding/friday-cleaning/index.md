# Friday cleaning
	- Idea is to put conscious effort to [Maintaining code base](docs/cse/coding/maintaining-code-base/index/) making small incremental
	  quantifiable changes to the code base.
	- Pick one small piece of code that you can make better in couple of hours
	- Make a "how to use" article/wiki.
	- Add unit test to existing code. Try and increase coverage by [One percent rule](logseq/bak/one-percent-rule/2025-06-25t18_36_37315zdesktop/)
	- Add automation for an existing uncovered use case.
