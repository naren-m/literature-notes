# success

## [Outliers](logseq/bak/highlights/books/outliers/2024-10-05t08_51_53409zdesktop/) 

says success is not personal, we owe some part of it to parentage and patronage. i agree with that fact. We are previlaged to be born in a family that can afford for our education and we are hard working enought to get to a spot.

- ***Achievement is talent plus preparation***.

  - The problem with this view is thatthe careers of the gifted,
    - the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and
    - the bigger the role preparation seems to play.

- Research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school,

  - the thing that distinguishes one performer from ***another is how hard he or she works***. That’s it.
  - And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else.
  - They work much, much harder.

## [Grit](highlights/books/grit/)

Pete’s idol, basketball coach John Wooden, was fond of saying, “Success is never final; failure is never fatal. It’s courage that counts.” What I wanted to know is how a culture of grit continues not just in the afterglow of success, but in the aftermath of failure. What I wanted to know is how Pete and the Seahawks found the courage to continue. ([Location 3684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3684))

## [Atomic Habits](logseq/bak/highlights/books/atomic-habits/2025-06-25t18_36_37332zdesktop/)

- Time magnifies the margin between [success](success/) and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. (Location 317)
