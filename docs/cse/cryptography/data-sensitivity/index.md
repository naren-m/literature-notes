# Data Sensitivity

The most frequent goal of the attackers is data. This includes:
- Identity theft
- Stealing data
- Modifying data
- Ransomware
- Information disclosure

Protect data in all states
- At rest
- At transit
- In memory

#### P1
P1 data is personally identifiable information (PII). This is highly sensitive personal data that identifies a specific individual.
- Government ID
- Credit card
- Email address
- Ocular
Secure with the highest level of security.

#### P2
P2 is personally anonymous data. These are attributes that can identify you but also others.
- Hair color
- Address
- Mother maiden name
- Name of High School

This data is semi sensitive.

#### P3
P3 data does not have personal significance. Be sure that the data is not miscategorized, which has been the source of several attacks.
