# CIA Triad

CIA Triad is a reference to [confidentiality](docs/cse/cryptography/confidentiality/index/), [integrity](docs/cse/cryptography/integrity/index/), and [availability](docs/cse/cryptography/availability/index/), which are the pillars of security. 


Each is a category of security:

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the heart of cryptography, which is protecting sensitive data.
Applying encryption to data provides confidentiality.

## Integrity

Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.

[Hashing](docs/cse/cryptography/hashing/index/) algorithms are used to confirm integrity.

## Availability

Availability means resources and services are available as expected.

Digital signatures, a combination of [Hashing](docs/cse/cryptography/hashing/index/) and [Encryption](docs/cse/cryptography/encryption/index/), can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
