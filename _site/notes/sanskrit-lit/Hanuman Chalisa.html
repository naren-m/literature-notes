      <h1 id="hanuman-chalisa">Hanuman Chalisa</h1>

<p>The Shri Hanuman chalisa is written in [[Awadhi]], sublanguage (बोली) of Hindi language.</p>

<p>Awadhi is primarily spoken language in “Awadh Region” of Uttar Pradesh , mainly in Faizabad,Sultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Pratapgarh, Ametthi , Gonda and some parts of Basti.</p>

<p>However Awadhi word is derived from Awadh. The pure form of Awadhi can be seen in Ayodhya, Faizabad, Ambedkar Nagar and Sultanpur.</p>

<p>The Shri Hanuman Chalisa was written by Saint Goswami [[Tulsidas]] ji Maharaj. The book name is “[[Shri Ram Charit Manas]]” in which the prayer Shri Hanuman Chalisa is taken.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The reality is that most people have an inner fixed-mindset pessimist in them right alongside their inner growth-mindset optimist. Recognizing this is important because it’s easy to make the mistake of changing what we say without changing our body language, facial expressions, and behavior. So what should we do? A good first step is to watch for mismatches between our words and actions. When we slip up—and we will—we can simply acknowledge that it’s hard to move away from a fixed, pessimistic view of the world. One of Carol’s colleagues, Susan Mackie, works with CEOs and encourages them to give names to their inner fixed-mindset characters. Then they can say things like “Oops. I guess I brought Controlling Claire to the meeting today. Let me try that again.” Or: “Overwhelmed Olivia is struggling to deal with all the competing demands, can you help me think this through?” Ultimately, adopting a gritty perspective involves recognizing that people get better at things—they grow. Just as we want to cultivate the ability to get up off the floor when life has knocked us down, we want to give those around us the benefit of the doubt when something they’ve tried isn’t a raging success. There’s always tomorrow. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B010MH9V3W&amp;location=2583">Location 2583</a>)
