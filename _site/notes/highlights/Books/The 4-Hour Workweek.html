  <li>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. —MARK TWAIN (Location 221)</li>
  <li>Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. —OSCAR WILDE, Irish dramatist (Location 223)</li>
  <li>I never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job descriptions as self-descriptions. (Location 249)</li>
  <li>Here is the step-by-step process you’ll use to reinvent yourself: D  for Definition turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the rules and objectives of the new game. It replaces self-defeating assumptions and explains concepts such as relative wealth and eustress.1 Who are the NR and how do they operate? This section explains the overall lifestyle design recipe—the fundamentals—before we add the three ingredients. E  for Elimination kills the obsolete notion of time management once and for all. It shows exactly how I used the words of an often-forgotten Italian economist to turn 12-hour days into two-hour days … in 48 hours. Increase your per-hour results ten times or more with counterintuitive NR techniques for cultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and otherwise ignoring the unimportant. This section provides the first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time. A  for Automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision. From bracketing to the routines of ultrasuccessful NR, it’s all here. This section provides the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income. L  for Liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. The concept of mini-retirements is introduced, as are the means for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is not about cheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section delivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility.   I should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend one hour in the office each day, and employees should therefore read the steps in the entrepreneurially minded DEAL order but implement them as DELA.

  <li>An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field. —NIELS BOHR, Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner Ordinarily he was insane, but he had lucid moments when he was merely stupid. —HEINRICH HEINE, German (Location 341)</li>
  <li>Reality is merely an illusion,albeit a very persistent one. —ALBERT EINSTEIN (Location 426)</li>
  <li>These individuals have riches just as we say that we “have a fever,” when really the fever has us. — SENECA (4 (Location 431)</li>
  <li>I also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters. — HENRY DAVID THOREAU (1817–1862) 1:00 A.M. (Location 434)</li>
  <li>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. —RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, (Location 484)</li>
  <li>Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them. —BILL COSBY (Location 516)</li>
  <li>Once you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life. —JOHN F. KENNEDY (Location 536)</li>
  <li>I can’t give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time. —HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE, American editor and journalist; first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize Everything popular is wrong. —OSCAR WILDE, The Importance of Being Earnest (Location 577)</li>
  <li>The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind throughout this book. (Location 621)</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance. (Location 622)</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Interest and Energy Are Cyclical. (Location 637)</li>

  <li>Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. —BENJAMIN DISRAELI, former British Prime Minister (Location 775)</li>
  <li>What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action. 5. (Location 886)</li>
  <li>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. —GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists (Location 911)</li>
  <li>The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom. (Location 965)</li>
  <li>Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. (Location 966)</li>
  <li>When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. (Location 967)</li>
  <li>This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?” (Location 968)

  <li>Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away. —ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY, pioneer of international postal flight and author of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) (Location 1164)</li>
  <li>It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. —WILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300–1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor” (Location 1167)</li>
  <li>The intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you follow the instructions, is an increase in personal productivity between 100 and 500%. The principles are the same for both employees and entrepreneurs, but the purpose of this increased productivity is completely different. (Location 1184)</li>
  <li>First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase negotiating leverage for two simultaneous objectives: pay raises and a remote working arrangement. Recall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the general process of joining the New Rich is D-E-A-L, in that order, but that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to implement the process as D-E-L-A.

  <li>What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things. (Location 1213)</li>
  <li>What gets measured gets managed. —PETER DRUCKER, management theorist, author of 31 books, recipient of Presidential Medal of Freedom (Location 1217)</li>
  <li>“Pareto’s Law” or the “Pareto Distribution,” in the last decade also popularly called the “80/20 Principle.” (Location 1224)</li>
  <li>Pareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs. (Location 1228)</li>
  <li>I began a dissection of my business and personal life through the lenses of two questions: Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? (Location 1239)</li>
  <li>lack of time is actually lack of priorities. (Location 1298)</li>
  <li>Since we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we would fill 15. If we have an emergency and need to suddenly leave work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously complete those assignments in 2 hours. It is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau in the spring of 2000. (Location 1315)</li>
  <li>Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It (Location 1330)</li>
  <li>This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of each other: Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). (Location 1334)

  <li>From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18 and producing four times the results. (Location 1366)</li>
  <li>At least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the following question: Am I being productive or just active? Charney captured the essence of this with less-abstract wording: Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important? He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead of showing dedication. Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat. It is possible to have your cupcake and eat it, too. (Location 1369)</li>
  <li>The key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which should be used together: (1) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. (Location 1380)</li>
  <li>In general terms, there are but two questions: What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness? (Location 1381)</li>
