# Fingerprint

What is a digital fingerprint?
There is often confusion about the definition of a digital fingerprint versus [digital signatures](cse/cryptography/digital-signatures/).
A digital fingerprint is a hash of a [public key](cse/cryptography/public-key/) (discussed shortly).
Two parties with shared knowledge of a [public key](cse/cryptography/public-key/) can exchange the key using the hash. The hash becomes a factor for authentication.
