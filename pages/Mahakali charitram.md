		  00:00:17.240 namaskarum
		  00:00:18.840 and shupa navaratri to all of
		  00:00:22.199 you it is a bhagam to spend this time
		  00:00:25.680 with all of you who are here in person
		  00:00:27.760 and all of you who are watching this
		  00:00:29.480 virtually um I'm sure it's been said
		  00:00:32.719 already but if your phones can be where
		  00:00:35.200 they should be which is in your bag for
		  00:00:37.120 the next one and a half hours
		  00:00:39.680 uh that and not on the loudest possible
		  00:00:42.559 mode that would help us um also I just
		  00:00:47.120 before we begin I just want to give a
		  00:00:48.879 few disclaimers this is not an academic
		  00:00:51.600 session so if you are hearing something
		  00:00:53.680 and you feel oh I've missed taking a
		  00:00:55.280 note about it it's okay whatever is
		  00:00:58.320 meant to go in will go in whatever is
		  00:01:00.320 meant to germinate will germinate when
		  00:01:01.760 it has to so be under no pressure of any
		  00:01:03.840 sort because the approach in a scholarly
		  00:01:06.880 session is very different and the
		  00:01:08.400 approach in heart sessions is very
		  00:01:11.040 different and this is moving entirely
		  00:01:14.720 from the latter
		  00:01:16.119 space so with that Vishnar Vishnar
		  00:01:19.960 Vishna we sit
		  00:01:22.119 here at the dawn of Navaratri avatar has
		  00:01:26.000 just begun
		  00:01:28.200 and the the beautiful salpam that
		  00:01:31.600 everybody has taken is that collectively
		  00:01:34.000 we are spending about six 4 and a half
		  00:01:36.720 to 6 hours sitting here the next 3 days
		  00:01:40.640 listening to one story so the question
		  00:01:44.159 that I'm going to invite you to ask
		  00:01:45.840 yourself before we begin is what are you
		  00:01:48.399 seeking from this story because the
		  00:01:51.600 beauty of Bhagavat Kata is irrespective
		  00:01:54.880 of what the question is irrespective of
		  00:01:57.119 how personal the question is Bhagavat
		  00:01:59.840 Kata which looks like a one-sizefits-all
		  00:02:03.280 has an answer for every single being so
		  00:02:06.399 if there is something that you are
		  00:02:08.520 seeking this the answers are hidden in
		  00:02:11.120 here and mark my words you will find
		  00:02:13.360 them all you have to do is be open to
		  00:02:15.920 receiving them there's a very beautiful
		  00:02:19.120 um and a very appropriate story in this
		  00:02:21.040 context it's about
		  00:02:22.680 how when we are waiting for a message
		  00:02:25.920 the message can come from any side so
		  00:02:28.879 there is this man who captures a parrot
		  00:02:31.120 when he goes to a forest and this is in
		  00:02:33.120 the mountains so he captures this parrot
		  00:02:35.440 and puts it into a cage and brings it
		  00:02:38.160 all the way to his home and he keeps the
		  00:02:40.560 parrot there the parrot is very unhappy
		  00:02:42.959 so one day he looks at the parrot and he
		  00:02:44.720 says "I'm going back to that same forest
		  00:02:47.360 in the mountains for a trek where I
		  00:02:49.360 captured you maybe your friends are all
		  00:02:51.599 there and they miss you i'll ask them if
		  00:02:54.400 they have anything to say to you if they
		  00:02:55.840 have any messages for you but whatever
		  00:02:57.840 they say I'm not going to leave you." So
		  00:03:00.560 the parrot says "Okay what can you do he
		  00:03:03.360 is captive." So this man goes back he
		  00:03:06.800 goes back to the same forest and he
		  00:03:08.879 tells all these parrots you remember one
		  00:03:11.040 of your friends here is missing because
		  00:03:13.760 I took him and went do any of you have
		  00:03:15.920 anything to say to him i will relay that
		  00:03:18.080 message so many of them say "Please ask
		  00:03:20.159 him to come back we really miss him
		  00:03:21.840 please set him free." This man ignores
		  00:03:23.920 all of that he says this to one parrot
		  00:03:27.120 one parrot is sitting on the branch and
		  00:03:29.440 the moment he tells this parrot that I
		  00:03:31.360 took your friend and I've kept him in my
		  00:03:33.519 cage this parrot drops just drops onto
		  00:03:36.000 the floor so he thinks "Oh this must be
		  00:03:38.640 a mate of that parrot." And now hearing
		  00:03:40.640 that that parrot is with me and I've
		  00:03:42.799 captured it this one's heart has broken
		  00:03:45.280 what can I do it's died now what can I
		  00:03:47.280 do so he goes back to his home he goes
		  00:03:50.239 to the parrot in the cage and he says
		  00:03:51.519 "You know I told all your friends what
		  00:03:54.560 that you were with me and that I'm not
		  00:03:56.879 going to release you." One of them as
		  00:03:59.280 soon as I told her this she dropped dead
		  00:04:01.439 onto the ground hearing this the parrot
		  00:04:04.560 inside the cage also dropped and then
		  00:04:07.840 the man thought "Oh god this guy is also
		  00:04:10.159 dead." And he opened the cage door and
		  00:04:12.480 the parrot the parrot flew out and he
		  00:04:15.280 said "That was my friend in the forest
		  00:04:17.358 giving me a
		  00:04:18.440 message of how to escape everyone else
		  00:04:21.040 was telling me you have to escape." My
		  00:04:22.639 friend there was giving me that message
		  00:04:24.720 why I'm sharing the story is this is
		  00:04:26.400 what Bhagavat Kata is it can look plain
		  00:04:29.040 and simple this kata can finish in three
		  00:04:31.120 sentences di killed Madukha dvi killed
		  00:04:33.919 Mahishasra dvi killed Shumba Nishumba
		  00:04:36.400 for that 3 days 6 hours
		  00:04:39.080 sir the beauty is when you sit and
		  00:04:42.160 you're willing to sit with what comes
		  00:04:43.840 from here the messages become personal
		  00:04:46.560 if there is any space of your life that
		  00:04:48.880 you want to build Navaratri is the time
		  00:04:51.280 for that navaratri is that sadhana
		  00:04:54.080 navaratri beyond color coordination on
		  00:04:56.720 each day is a day is a time period it's
		  00:05:00.720 a collective of nine nights where we
		  00:05:03.120 have the potential to reorganize
		  00:05:05.280 something that's happening here because
		  00:05:06.960 the energies in the universe support us
		  00:05:09.039 and the easiest way to do that is
		  00:05:10.960 bhagavat katha if there is something
		  00:05:12.720 physical on your mind that is bothering
		  00:05:14.400 you something material that the answers
		  00:05:16.720 to that will be here if there is
		  00:05:18.240 something spiritual that you are seeking
		  00:05:20.400 the answers to that will here everything
		  00:05:22.400 is here you just have to know how to
		  00:05:24.320 look for it so with that invitation we
		  00:05:27.840 go into Bhagavat Kata and into what kata
		  00:05:31.039 into one extraordinary kata i know you
		  00:05:34.320 must be thinking every time he starts he
		  00:05:36.240 says that but I can't help it the nature
		  00:05:38.880 of this is like that this kata has a
		  00:05:42.160 marketkedly different place in Sanatana
		  00:05:44.479 Dharma the kata that we are about to
		  00:05:46.720 share which I already gave you a prelude
		  00:05:48.919 to predominantly has three main stories
		  00:05:52.240 to it the pratamacharitra the madhyama
		  00:05:55.280 chararitra and the utttaritra where do
		  00:05:57.759 we find this kata this kata is a
		  00:06:01.960 congregation of I think 518
		  00:06:05.639 shlokas but it is known as the satashati
		  00:06:09.919 which means 700 if you actually take the
		  00:06:12.240 number of shlokas it will not be 700
		  00:06:14.400 there are 700 mantras in here so for
		  00:06:16.560 that reason they have called it as
		  00:06:17.720 sapashati what sapashati is it known as
		  00:06:21.120 dura sapashati chandi satashati but the
		  00:06:24.319 actual title given to this as many of
		  00:06:26.479 you would be knowing is dvi mahatma
		  00:06:28.960 saptashati came more as a reference
		  00:06:31.360 saying that it has 700
		  00:06:34.280 mantras/ shlokas where do we find this
		  00:06:38.319 why I say that this is extraordinary is
		  00:06:40.720 based on where we find it we find this
		  00:06:43.120 in the marandea puranam now this portion
		  00:06:46.400 that we find in the marandea puranam
		  00:06:48.560 called the dvi mahatmam is the only
		  00:06:51.600 portion of any puranam which is used in
		  00:06:55.680 a hom when we perform any hom be it a
		  00:06:58.560 laalita hom be it a rdra hom be it a
		  00:07:02.000 dhanantri hom sudashana hom various
		  00:07:04.160 types we do not directly use a purana
		  00:07:07.199 kata to offer the autis except in this
		  00:07:10.160 case many of you would be familiar with
		  00:07:12.080 the concept of chundi hom it is
		  00:07:13.759 especially well known during navaratri
		  00:07:15.360 time it is typically done on ashtami and
		  00:07:17.280 nami at that time this practice of
		  00:07:20.639 chundi homam of chundi parayanam is one
		  00:07:24.000 thing that is common across shaky
		  00:07:26.000 sadhana in this country and beyond
		  00:07:28.240 because if you look at geographically
		  00:07:30.400 the growth of Shakta of the Shakta
		  00:07:33.120 philosophy in Dakshina Bharatam
		  00:07:35.120 especially in Tamil Nadu Karnataka and
		  00:07:37.280 in Andhra Pradesh is where you see Shvya
		  00:07:39.919 sraaya but for the rest of the country
		  00:07:42.080 in many portions it is chundi so you go
		  00:07:43.840 to the north it is chundi part you go to
		  00:07:45.520 the east towards Bengal side there also
		  00:07:47.280 it is chundi part you go towards the
		  00:07:49.120 west all of the garbha and where
		  00:07:51.280 navaratri happens with dandia there also
		  00:07:53.120 it is chundi part in the south also it
		  00:07:54.960 is chundipara
		  00:07:56.240 the the suffixes are changing but the
		  00:07:58.319 essence is chundi is everywhere so this
		  00:08:01.360 particular story has a very powerful and
		  00:08:04.319 a very prominent place when it comes to
		  00:08:06.720 shaky sadhana that placement is because
		  00:08:09.520 of the magic in here and for the next 3
		  00:08:12.319 days that's all we are going to do we're
		  00:08:14.080 just going to unfold that magic and see
		  00:08:16.639 what comes and speaks to us because this
		  00:08:20.360 story starts itself with a very
		  00:08:22.800 interesting context the story setting is
		  00:08:26.639 indicating that the rishi has something
		  00:08:28.639 in mind the rishi begins maranda begins
		  00:08:31.759 saying come let me tell you in detail
		  00:08:35.760 the story of the one who is about or the
		  00:08:40.399 one who became the eighth manu so every
		  00:08:44.159 time the the concept of time in sanatana
		  00:08:46.480 dharma is that time is ruled by there
		  00:08:50.080 are certain periods of time that are
		  00:08:51.519 ruled by different manus in the present
		  00:08:54.160 context we are in the manvantra
		  00:08:56.720 manvantara is because it belongs to manu
		  00:08:58.640 ruled by vasa so we say vasata manvant
		  00:09:01.680 on a daily basis in the salpa so he says
		  00:09:05.040 let me tell you like this the story of
		  00:09:07.680 the eighth Manu but if you read the
		  00:09:10.399 story left to right right to left front
		  00:09:12.640 to back back to front Manu comes in one
		  00:09:16.080 place in the
		  00:09:17.240 story but a rishi is speaking and a
		  00:09:20.160 rishi is saying I'll tell you the story
		  00:09:21.600 of the eth manu but he's not telling the
		  00:09:23.760 story of the eth manu so is it a lie
		  00:09:26.240 rishi will not speak a lie the first
		  00:09:29.200 shloka of chandishati itself is a
		  00:09:33.080 mystery but that we will not reveal just
		  00:09:35.440 now so keep this in mind he's saying I
		  00:09:38.560 will tell you the story of a Manu but he
		  00:09:41.040 begins with something else he has an
		  00:09:42.800 intention let that intention emerge when
		  00:09:45.040 it has to and then he starts off he
		  00:09:48.000 starts off not with Davi's story he
		  00:09:50.480 starts off with the story of one king
		  00:09:54.399 who lived very comfortably who lived
		  00:09:57.839 with power with fame with glory until
		  00:10:01.839 enemies attacked his kingdom and when
		  00:10:04.080 they attacked his
		  00:10:05.560 kingdom he realized that he was no
		  00:10:08.399 longer happy here in his own kingdom he
		  00:10:10.560 was being treated like a prisoner so on
		  00:10:13.360 the pretext of coming of hunting he
		  00:10:15.839 comes off to the forest and when he
		  00:10:17.839 comes to the forest he doesn't want to
		  00:10:19.920 go back his heart is broken because he's
		  00:10:22.480 seen his enemies enter the kingdom and
		  00:10:25.040 just imagine what it would feel like we
		  00:10:26.800 don't have to be kings to imagine it
		  00:10:28.240 imagine if someone came and took over
		  00:10:29.760 our home and everybody who was loving
		  00:10:31.920 towards us is now paying attention to
		  00:10:34.000 that person this is happening at a royal
		  00:10:36.240 scale that's all the differences and he
		  00:10:38.480 thinks he says "I wonder how my elephant
		  00:10:41.200 is doing i used to take care of that
		  00:10:43.120 elephant with so much love i don't know
		  00:10:45.200 if they're feeding that elephant the
		  00:10:46.640 right grain or not i wonder my ministers
		  00:10:49.760 who used to say "Oh Raja you are the
		  00:10:51.600 most fantastic one." Now they'll be
		  00:10:53.519 saying the same things to the other
		  00:10:55.040 person extremely normal human problems
		  00:10:58.560 no Vantaganam here to begin with and as
		  00:11:02.399 he's going through in the forest like
		  00:11:03.920 this he comes across an ash of a
		  00:11:07.079 rishi he goes into this ash and even in
		  00:11:10.959 this ashum physically he's in the ashram
		  00:11:12.959 mentally he's in his kingdom the first
		  00:11:15.920 message in chandi is here for all those
		  00:11:18.640 people who
		  00:11:20.279 say
		  00:11:22.040 mountains body can go to the mountains
		  00:11:24.160 mind mind if it's still stuck here if
		  00:11:26.079 it's of no use the king is only in these
		  00:11:28.800 beautiful settings but his mind is still
		  00:11:30.720 troubled and when he's sitting here like
		  00:11:33.040 this he meets someone else so this king
		  00:11:36.320 whose name is Surata remember these
		  00:11:38.320 names okay because on the third day they
		  00:11:40.160 will come back and in between to check
		  00:11:41.839 whether you're awake or not I'll ask you
		  00:11:43.200 their names as well this king Surata
		  00:11:46.640 meets someone else who has also come and
		  00:11:48.480 he says who are you he says my name is
		  00:11:51.160 Samadhi and I am here because my wife
		  00:11:54.959 and my children threw me out of the home
		  00:11:57.600 because I was no longer an earning
		  00:11:59.480 member so this king is concerned and
		  00:12:03.040 also misery loves company up till now in
		  00:12:05.760 the ashram everybody is so happy except
		  00:12:07.600 this king now he has seen one more face
		  00:12:09.760 that is pulled down like his so he's
		  00:12:11.360 happy this fellow is also not well good
		  00:12:13.760 something is common now between I can I
		  00:12:15.600 don't have to feel like I'm the only one
		  00:12:16.959 here in fact there was one um commentary
		  00:12:19.920 on Chandis Shhati that I was reading and
		  00:12:22.399 the commentary begins with literally
		  00:12:24.560 this sentence the English translation of
		  00:12:26.560 the commentary begins with a sentence
		  00:12:28.320 two unlucky losers meet in a
		  00:12:30.680 forest but thankfully our rishies did
		  00:12:33.360 not resort to language like that because
		  00:12:35.600 the naming that they used and the
		  00:12:37.440 context that they set so look at one
		  00:12:39.200 king the first person the king Surata
		  00:12:42.000 surata is deeply disturbed by the
		  00:12:44.800 enemies attacking his kingdom and his
		  00:12:46.880 mind is still on the kingdom now he
		  00:12:48.880 meets Samadhi samadhi has been thrown
		  00:12:51.839 out of his home and Surata asks him
		  00:12:53.839 "What are you thinking about?" He says
		  00:12:55.279 "I'm thinking about my children are they
		  00:12:57.440 well are they well-mannered are they
		  00:12:59.360 badly behaved are they taking care of
		  00:13:01.680 each other is everything okay with
		  00:13:03.279 them?" And Surata says "I my problem at
		  00:13:06.000 least is real power i had actual enemies
		  00:13:08.079 come in in your case your family has
		  00:13:10.959 thrown you out and you still are
		  00:13:13.440 actually thinking about their welfare
		  00:13:15.920 how is this he says what can I do even
		  00:13:19.040 though I know they've thrown me out even
		  00:13:21.040 though I know they are bringing me pain
		  00:13:23.519 I'm not able to stop thinking of them
		  00:13:26.000 look at this now is it becoming an
		  00:13:27.600 extremely personal story in our own
		  00:13:29.680 lives there are many many a case when
		  00:13:32.560 people close to us bring us pain and
		  00:13:35.440 we're unable to distance ourselves from
		  00:13:37.200 them we're still going back into cycles
		  00:13:39.680 of constantly thinking about them then
		  00:13:41.920 what do both of these people do they go
		  00:13:44.240 into the ash of the rishi whose asham
		  00:13:46.880 they are sitting in and that rishi by
		  00:13:49.279 name sumedha they go they offered the
		  00:13:52.000 namaskaram toss to sumedha and then they
		  00:13:54.240 begin so sura introduces himself and
		  00:13:56.760 samadhi and his introduction is very
		  00:13:59.199 interesting this is also a lesson in
		  00:14:00.959 human psychology as soon as he goes he
		  00:14:03.360 says my name is Surata i used to be a
		  00:14:06.079 king etc etc this is Samadhi this is his
		  00:14:09.240 backstory and you know what we are here
		  00:14:12.920 suffering and even though we know even
		  00:14:17.600 though we
		  00:14:19.959 are even though we are Gyanis we are
		  00:14:22.959 suffering why that question is
		  00:14:25.760 indicating how much arrogance is there
		  00:14:28.240 how much unconscious arrogance is there
		  00:14:30.720 in the ask in the person who's asking
		  00:14:35.600 and immediately Sumedha looks at him
		  00:14:37.839 sumedha Dishi looks at both of them and
		  00:14:39.760 he says what nyanam are you speaking of
		  00:14:43.199 nyanam is something birds have animals
		  00:14:46.399 have human beings have every living
		  00:14:48.399 being has nyanam every living being
		  00:14:51.120 knows how to feed itself to survive
		  00:14:53.600 every living being knows what to do to
		  00:14:57.199 avoid attack by a predator and to keep
		  00:14:59.920 itself alive that banana every being has
		  00:15:02.959 which bananaam you are talking about
		  00:15:05.839 and then Sumedha starts they have come
		  00:15:08.639 to ask now look at this context there is
		  00:15:12.160 one person who is struggling and saying
		  00:15:14.480 enemies are attacking it's bothering me
		  00:15:17.040 there is another person who is saying
		  00:15:19.839 even though they are enemies to me I'm
		  00:15:22.639 not able to stop thinking of them put
		  00:15:25.600 them into one character and one person
		  00:15:28.399 had exactly this same problem when he
		  00:15:31.279 entered the battlefield and he said I
		  00:15:32.959 can't fight them they're not my enemies
		  00:15:34.480 they're my family i don't want to fight
		  00:15:36.639 them what do I do who is
		  00:15:38.839 that and then who became the guru to
		  00:15:42.680 Arjuna how many shlokas in
		  00:15:45.399 that how many
		  00:15:47.720 here the connection starts here that
		  00:15:51.839 Bhagavat Gita is called as
		  00:15:56.839 upha this is upasana
		  00:16:00.320 there are two different terms meaning
		  00:16:02.000 that this is the one you worship and
		  00:16:04.399 this is identical to that the tum is
		  00:16:07.680 hidden from the context here it is two
		  00:16:10.720 beings that have come there arjuna
		  00:16:12.720 vishad yogam is one entire chapter here
		  00:16:15.199 it starts off and Sumedha talks to them
		  00:16:17.600 and he says you think you'reanis know
		  00:16:20.880 look at the world around don't think
		  00:16:23.440 that what has happened to you is
		  00:16:25.839 happening because or despite you being
		  00:16:29.240 aani there is something in this universe
		  00:16:32.560 that is fooling and deluding every
		  00:16:35.360 single being in the universe and he
		  00:16:37.519 gives two beautiful examples he says
		  00:16:39.680 look at birds if you look at birds that
		  00:16:42.320 have just hatched eggs They will take 2x
		  00:16:46.160 the effort to find food and come they
		  00:16:48.160 will be starving they know that they are
		  00:16:50.399 starving but they will still feed their
		  00:16:52.000 children he says those birds are getting
		  00:16:54.000 deluded by some power birds that will
		  00:16:56.560 otherwise take care of themselves and
		  00:16:58.480 the second example he gives hits home a
		  00:17:00.720 little harder he says look at parents
		  00:17:03.839 who have children and pour love on them
		  00:17:06.799 only to expect things back from their
		  00:17:08.839 children they are also deluded by some
		  00:17:11.280 super force these birds also animals
		  00:17:13.839 also everything in this universe is
		  00:17:16.559 deluded by some force what is that force
		  00:17:19.839 and who is deluding us now it's nice no
		  00:17:22.079 till now if you told me problem is in my
		  00:17:23.679 mind I didn't like it now you told me
		  00:17:25.599 nala problem actually it's coming from
		  00:17:27.359 there it's very relaxing saying okay
		  00:17:29.280 then tell me who it is but Sumedha is
		  00:17:31.840 not a storyteller sumedha is a guru so
		  00:17:35.440 Sumedha says let me tell you about the
		  00:17:38.240 one that is deluding and the curiosity
		  00:17:42.160 comes now so he says who is this sumedha
		  00:17:45.679 says this deluding force is not an
		  00:17:48.240 ordinary force in samskam whenever there
		  00:17:50.799 is a parabam an uttam when they want to
		  00:17:54.240 show something in the highest order they
		  00:17:56.160 use the words maha because maha
		  00:17:58.880 indicates that we translate it as great
		  00:18:00.720 but maha is a much it's a feeling
		  00:18:02.720 greater than great so he says this
		  00:18:05.600 deluding force this delusion is called
		  00:18:08.400 as maya and the one who is causing it is
		  00:18:10.799 called as
		  00:18:11.960 mahamaya and he says tell me about the
		  00:18:14.320 prahavam tell me about the swarupam tell
		  00:18:16.799 me about the udhavam where did she come
		  00:18:18.559 from where what what is what is so
		  00:18:21.200 unique about this mahammaya and then
		  00:18:23.200 Sumedha starts and he says this
		  00:18:26.039 Mahammaya is clouding the universe in
		  00:18:28.960 every atom she is there but she takes a
		  00:18:33.039 form whenever her devotees need her
		  00:18:36.240 sumeda is saying it in third person
		  00:18:38.160 krishna said it in first person that's
		  00:18:40.400 all the
		  00:18:46.120 differences at that time I will come for
		  00:18:49.280 my bhtas and same thing Sumeda says
		  00:18:52.480 about her only the gender is changing
		  00:18:56.000 let's not worry about that let's focus
		  00:18:57.679 on the tatwa so he begins the story of
		  00:19:01.039 Mahammaya and he says look at this
		  00:19:03.840 beautiful story and the context here are
		  00:19:06.720 two beings who came here asking about
		  00:19:09.120 their problems and here is someone
		  00:19:11.280 telling them a seemingly unconnected
		  00:19:13.600 story saying oh you're having this
		  00:19:15.440 problem I'll tell you a story he should
		  00:19:17.520 listen to their problem
		  00:19:18.919 no he knows what the pain point in their
		  00:19:23.520 story is so the beauty of the three
		  00:19:26.160 charitrams is there are two people
		  00:19:28.799 who need whose hearts are in are burning
		  00:19:31.919 and in these three stories one story is
		  00:19:34.960 told for both of them together one story
		  00:19:37.520 is told for the king whose name is and
		  00:19:40.559 one is told for the merchant whose name
		  00:19:42.640 is
		  00:19:43.960 Samadhi in this extremely personal
		  00:19:47.200 retelling he doesn't say surah this
		  00:19:49.679 portion is for you he just begins the
		  00:19:52.720 story and we understand oh this is why
		  00:19:55.200 it is being told for Surata so here is
		  00:19:57.520 how the context begins he says at the
		  00:20:01.679 very beginning of time before this yugum
		  00:20:04.960 began before this mahay yugum began for
		  00:20:07.200 those of you who are interested in
		  00:20:08.720 mathematics which I am certainly not but
		  00:20:10.720 I will just relay some information to
		  00:20:12.480 you that the concept in sanatana dharma
		  00:20:15.200 is kalam is kala chakrram it is cyclic
		  00:20:18.160 so it's not linear so time constantly
		  00:20:21.200 repeats itself there are certain
		  00:20:24.320 mathematic calculations as to how much
		  00:20:26.960 time how much time before makes one
		  00:20:30.360 yoga within one yoga or rather extending
		  00:20:33.039 from one yuga we have four yoga which
		  00:20:34.960 make one mah yoga so from here you get
		  00:20:37.120 various measurements or various units of
		  00:20:39.919 time so now the current time that the
		  00:20:43.200 story is starting in which Sumeda is
		  00:20:45.200 telling them is the time between two
		  00:20:48.440 kalpas and just to translate the
		  00:20:51.200 mathematics for those of you who are
		  00:20:53.000 interested 4 cr 32 lakh earth years make
		  00:20:58.400 one mahay
		  00:20:59.799 yoga 71 mah yogas make one
		  00:21:04.039 manvantra okay so I really don't know
		  00:21:06.159 how much that adds up to but the point
		  00:21:08.640 here is that it is showing you a
		  00:21:11.840 seemingly large span of time this is for
		  00:21:14.240 all those of us who are worried two
		  00:21:15.440 years ago that the earth was going to
		  00:21:16.720 end or something like that no there was
		  00:21:18.080 some 2019 a couple of years ago
		  00:21:19.919 according to some calendar relax we have
		  00:21:23.120 lots of
		  00:21:24.200 time and this story is about time so the
		  00:21:28.480 context is beautiful in between two
		  00:21:31.360 phases of creation in between these
		  00:21:35.520 everything goes back to the source
		  00:21:37.600 nothing gets destroyed destroying is a
		  00:21:41.120 word that we translate everything gets
		  00:21:43.760 dissolved in samskritam the concept of
		  00:21:46.320 dissolution is called as laya when that
		  00:21:49.760 laya is strong and everything goes back
		  00:21:52.559 to where it came from into that one
		  00:21:54.559 source praushtalaya it is called
		  00:21:57.159 praushtalaya is praya what we know it as
		  00:22:00.480 when that laya is so strong it is also
		  00:22:03.520 known as mahalaya we just had a mahalaya
		  00:22:07.360 amawasa where all the beings that are
		  00:22:10.159 not physically present with us get
		  00:22:12.400 pulled back into the source there are
		  00:22:14.159 various interpretations and
		  00:22:15.360 understanding of it but it is indication
		  00:22:19.440 of the dissolving nature of how
		  00:22:21.520 everything goes back and it gets hidden
		  00:22:23.919 who sees it the one who is responsible
		  00:22:27.120 for everything and will start the new
		  00:22:29.120 cycle it goes back into that being so in
		  00:22:33.039 this state where it's all gone back and
		  00:22:35.600 the next stage is about to start now the
		  00:22:38.159 next stage is about to start this
		  00:22:40.760 is in this context just when is getting
		  00:22:44.919 created paramatma that source into which
		  00:22:47.919 everything is gone it's formless it
		  00:22:50.440 has braha it has no characteristics it
		  00:22:54.080 has no form everything has gone back
		  00:22:56.159 into it but now it's starting again so
		  00:22:58.640 everything that went in must now
		  00:23:00.159 germinate so the concept of it emerging
		  00:23:03.120 is paramatma when paramatma has to
		  00:23:05.520 create paramatma will take a form
		  00:23:07.200 paramatma is survaka paramatma is nakara
		  00:23:10.720 but when paramatma has to take a form
		  00:23:12.480 form paramatma becomes sakara
		  00:23:14.760 withanakara so he takes that form from
		  00:23:18.080 which everything germinates i used the
		  00:23:20.720 words nir and nirara nirkara became
		  00:23:24.000 sakara he took a form what is that form
		  00:23:27.200 lying on the endless waters of time
		  00:23:31.320 seated on or rather reclining on a snake
		  00:23:35.679 itself that represents time
		  00:23:39.280 or
		  00:23:40.520 aa on that snake the lord was reclining
		  00:23:46.039 shantaaramjagayam padman sam that's
		  00:23:48.480 swarup here the three gunas also have to
		  00:23:51.919 come from him now because only comes
		  00:23:55.200 into being when the three gonas are
		  00:23:56.880 there the three gonas make up the srishi
		  00:23:59.200 from the three gonas come the panchcham
		  00:24:00.559 mahabahhutas this will go into a lot of
		  00:24:02.240 technical philosophy but we will focus
		  00:24:04.880 on the essence the first is which
		  00:24:11.360 So first one is satwaguna satwaguna came
		  00:24:15.279 from his nabi kamalam from his navl came
		  00:24:18.320 a lotus and on that lotus brahmadeva sat
		  00:24:21.679 in this story brahadeva represents
		  00:24:23.880 satwagunam satwa has come not the
		  00:24:27.320 restaurant I'm talking about the gam the
		  00:24:30.640 other two have to come rajam rajogunam
		  00:24:34.000 and tamogunam where do they come from
		  00:24:38.919 vishnuh from vishnu's ear wax came two
		  00:24:42.480 raasas
		  00:24:44.000 These were rajogunam and tamogam now the
		  00:24:48.880 mahatm dvi mahhatm you have to read
		  00:24:51.120 every shlokum so carefully because the
		  00:24:54.400 rahasams will be hidden here madu and
		  00:24:56.559 kaitabha have come from here brahma has
		  00:24:59.679 come from here think this story will
		  00:25:03.360 make you think that means Vishnu is the
		  00:25:06.080 father to assuras also assuras have also
		  00:25:09.120 come from him dvata was has also come
		  00:25:11.360 from him what is the connection vishnu
		  00:25:14.520 is consciousness from consciousness
		  00:25:17.760 satwa rajas and tamas will come
		  00:25:20.880 consciousness is not affected by them
		  00:25:23.440 vishnu is beyond them and that state
		  00:25:25.760 that he is in is truly beyond them
		  00:25:28.080 because he is in a state of restful
		  00:25:31.159 awareness he's resting but he's aware of
		  00:25:34.240 what's happening but the beautiful word
		  00:25:37.120 that Sanatana Dharma coins for this no
		  00:25:39.200 there is not there isn't a translation
		  00:25:40.960 available or a translatable available it
		  00:25:43.520 says so in the context of rest when we
		  00:25:46.960 lose any contact with the external world
		  00:25:50.320 that state of rest is called as nidra it
		  00:25:53.360 happens to us on a daily basis right we
		  00:25:55.039 we lose connection with the external
		  00:25:56.640 world we lose connection even with the
		  00:25:58.159 body when we are sleeping
		  00:26:00.559 this is nidra which is rest as I said
		  00:26:04.559 the second word restful awareness
		  00:26:06.960 awareness in samskritam is yoga
		  00:26:09.360 awareness is when you're alert about
		  00:26:10.960 everything that's happening inside and
		  00:26:13.480 outside the problem is these two don't
		  00:26:15.919 exist together awareness and rest are
		  00:26:18.799 not working together the only person
		  00:26:21.279 whom they can work together is paramatma
		  00:26:23.120 that is why veedum uses that word for
		  00:26:24.720 him saying he is in a state of yoga
		  00:26:26.480 nidra yoga is awareness nidra is lack of
		  00:26:29.760 awareness in that one person who they
		  00:26:32.000 are together they are there now yoga
		  00:26:34.880 nidra is a very very beautiful concept
		  00:26:36.400 and there are many people sitting here
		  00:26:37.919 who understand it much better than I do
		  00:26:40.480 but I'll just present you the idea of
		  00:26:42.240 what is this yoga nidra because yoga
		  00:26:44.320 nidra is not ordinary sleep we don't use
		  00:26:46.400 it when we sleep on a daily basis the
		  00:26:49.120 concept of yoga nidra is in that state
		  00:26:52.400 of rest is the preparation for the next
		  00:26:54.720 phase that paramatma is doing at a
		  00:26:56.880 cosmic level that happens annually as
		  00:27:00.400 well within the year for 4 months
		  00:27:04.000 Narayana goes into that yoga nidra that
		  00:27:06.480 starts in asharaamas and goes on till
		  00:27:08.960 kartikasam when he goes to sleep not an
		  00:27:12.000 ordinary sleepy and prahikadashi in
		  00:27:15.480 kartikhadashi when he awakens the idea
		  00:27:18.159 here is in this nidra the whole universe
		  00:27:21.919 goes into him and from there he starts
		  00:27:24.559 to create but the thing about nidra is
		  00:27:28.159 nidra has to leave us for us to get up
		  00:27:30.880 this doesn't require any philosophy to
		  00:27:33.120 understand no in the morning there is
		  00:27:36.080 there are people who who expand this
		  00:27:38.080 very beautifully in their discourses as
		  00:27:40.240 a child in the night if you have to make
		  00:27:42.559 your kids sleep parents will understand
		  00:27:44.159 this the same parent who's putting them
		  00:27:46.640 their kid to bed is the same parent
		  00:27:48.559 who's waking them up right in these two
		  00:27:51.440 states the parent is appearing to wake
		  00:27:53.440 up the child saying "Oh wake up yeah
		  00:27:55.679 time for your bus." The parent is
		  00:27:57.440 appearing to put the child to bed but
		  00:28:00.000 something inside is making the child
		  00:28:01.760 sleep something inside is making the
		  00:28:03.840 child get up unless that goes out the
		  00:28:06.720 child will not get up and unless that
		  00:28:08.640 goes in the child will not sleep we're
		  00:28:11.440 looking at the external causes look
		  00:28:13.360 inside look inside and observe what is
		  00:28:16.000 making us sleep now the context is set
		  00:28:19.960 paramatma chaitananyam satwa
		  00:28:23.000 buddhi rajab buddhi tamabddhi satwa
		  00:28:26.399 buddhi as soon as it comes it's sitting
		  00:28:28.399 quietly the indication of satwagonam
		  00:28:30.960 satwagunam makes us quiet it makes us
		  00:28:33.840 stop we're not concerned with what's
		  00:28:36.000 happening outside as soon as the other
		  00:28:38.399 two came thelokum says it so beautifully
		  00:28:41.039 it says as soon as they came they wanted
		  00:28:43.760 to go and fight with somebody saying
		  00:28:45.120 who's there to fight with that is
		  00:28:47.159 rajogam if you cannot You're
		  00:28:49.360 fundamentally unhappy you're restless
		  00:28:51.279 inside you will see how can I go poke
		  00:28:52.960 that next person what can I say to him
		  00:28:55.120 which will trouble him and not give him
		  00:28:56.799 sleep that's exactly what these raas are
		  00:28:59.279 embodying these are just things that are
		  00:29:01.200 happening inside our head that need to
		  00:29:04.240 poke somebody that need to say something
		  00:29:06.320 he said that to me last time we met
		  00:29:08.320 tomorrow when I meet him no I'll say
		  00:29:09.679 this to him tendencies rajogam it means
		  00:29:12.240 rajogam is active tamogam is very
		  00:29:14.799 relaxed on the contrary tamogam will say
		  00:29:16.640 sulpa can we just not do anything at all
		  00:29:19.279 that is
		  00:29:20.279 tamoga now rajogunam and tamogam have
		  00:29:23.360 come out as soon as they've come out
		  00:29:25.360 they want to fight because that's their
		  00:29:27.120 nature so they look no this guy is fast
		  00:29:31.279 asleep no sign of him getting up normal
		  00:29:33.279 nidra only is so difficult to wake
		  00:29:34.799 somebody out of yoga nidra imagine then
		  00:29:37.600 they see hey there is a stalk from his
		  00:29:39.679 lotus let's see who's there and then
		  00:29:42.240 they climb over there and then they go
		  00:29:44.320 on there and they found somebody that's
		  00:29:46.240 all they want raja Guram always wants
		  00:29:48.159 company because you need somebody to
		  00:29:49.840 fight with no so they look that poor man
		  00:29:52.559 up there he knows how to ride Vedas he
		  00:29:54.320 really doesn't know how to engage in
		  00:29:55.720 combat so he looks and he's immediately
		  00:29:58.480 perturbed and then they realize this old
		  00:30:00.799 man no point in fighting with him so
		  00:30:02.799 they come down and as they do this when
		  00:30:06.000 they are attacking him and they are
		  00:30:07.919 threatening him brahma satwagunam is in
		  00:30:11.520 a problem the state of mind that if I am
		  00:30:15.279 in a problem I don't know what to do I
		  00:30:17.600 pray to god that satagam it does exactly
		  00:30:20.080 that over here brahmadeva is very
		  00:30:21.760 perturbed now so the first thing he does
		  00:30:23.919 is he looks at vishnu vishnu is asleep
		  00:30:26.720 and he's thinking I have to do stotrum
		  00:30:29.840 to the one who is making Vishnu sleep
		  00:30:32.320 because if she leaves his body only then
		  00:30:34.640 can I wake him up that bhavam why
		  00:30:37.520 doesn't he do a sputy to Vishnu directly
		  00:30:40.080 because he's aware that there is a shy
		  00:30:42.080 which is in Vishnu's eyes which is in
		  00:30:43.760 Vishnu's nose which is in his ears just
		  00:30:46.559 think about a daily sleep when you're in
		  00:30:48.080 a deep sleep and if somebody calls out
		  00:30:49.840 to you you don't hear it when you're in
		  00:30:52.240 a deep sleep if you're in a light sleep
		  00:30:53.919 it's a different story but when you're
		  00:30:55.120 in a deep sleep even though you are
		  00:30:57.200 being called out to you don't hear it so
		  00:30:59.440 you shouldn't brahmade realizes I
		  00:31:00.960 shouldn't be calling him I should be
		  00:31:02.799 calling the one who is making him sleep
		  00:31:06.480 like this this idea Brahma recognizes
		  00:31:09.600 there's a shy inside him that is making
		  00:31:11.600 him sleep if that shy leaves him he will
		  00:31:14.080 get up so Brahma begins a stotraum now
		  00:31:17.279 this bhavam you see know you will see an
		  00:31:19.840 upasana margam in this that you have to
		  00:31:22.240 take the shi's help to reach paramatma
		  00:31:25.760 that is the same bhavam with which
		  00:31:27.600 shriishnavism also operates that you
		  00:31:30.000 need laxi support to reach naraya you
		  00:31:32.480 cannot reach naraya directly it's an
		  00:31:34.559 adaptation of this very concept now
		  00:31:37.600 there are narabas sitting here so for
		  00:31:39.519 this this is being said now as soon as
		  00:31:42.559 Brahma begins this tuty he does an
		  00:31:44.880 extraordinary stuti called as ratri
		  00:31:48.080 suktum this is this is not a suktum
		  00:31:50.960 strictly speaking suktams are what we
		  00:31:53.919 find in the vedas but he this is
		  00:31:56.159 distinctly called as a ratri he does a
		  00:31:58.799 stouty to ratri naratri we are in
		  00:32:01.960 Navaratri something powerful about the
		  00:32:04.480 idea of night because night in sanatana
		  00:32:07.760 dharma is not seen as something where
		  00:32:09.919 everything is dark it becomes a metaphor
		  00:32:11.919 for something it becomes a metaphor for
		  00:32:14.559 a resting place it is called as
		  00:32:17.320 jagatastanam is ratri where the whole
		  00:32:19.760 world gets dark simply don't say oh but
		  00:32:22.960 in the other half of the world it's
		  00:32:24.080 bright they'll also have ratri 12 hours
		  00:32:26.080 before or after you that's all the
		  00:32:27.440 differences so when everything goes
		  00:32:29.440 within that ratri state is also very
		  00:32:32.799 frightful because we don't know what
		  00:32:34.559 will happen in that time if you just
		  00:32:36.559 think about earlier times when we would
		  00:32:39.519 probably live in time you know places
		  00:32:41.600 closer to forests it's at night time
		  00:32:43.360 that you fear the predators the most
		  00:32:45.120 even now it's at night time that we fear
		  00:32:47.039 thieves and we we fear all of these
		  00:32:49.120 beings around us right in daytime when
		  00:32:50.880 there's sunlight there's no worry but in
		  00:32:52.799 Ratri anything can happen ratri kalum is
		  00:32:56.159 sadhana ratri is a very very powerful
		  00:32:59.840 time when we also lose consciousness
		  00:33:03.519 because that's what happens to us no
		  00:33:04.960 that's how our clocks are designed
		  00:33:06.240 within that we typically sleep in the
		  00:33:08.080 night and wake up in the morning so
		  00:33:10.000 brahadeva begins a ratri suktum why I
		  00:33:12.880 use the word suktum is there are various
		  00:33:15.279 ratri suktums that you find in vedas
		  00:33:17.200 there is a rigid ratri suktum there are
		  00:33:19.440 different portions in different vedas
		  00:33:21.440 that you find there is a samaved ratrium
		  00:33:23.679 and in that it is said that those who do
		  00:33:26.320 the ratri suktum with extreme devotion
		  00:33:30.640 to ratri dvi to jagat jani as ratri dvi
		  00:33:34.799 she will appear if their mantra if their
		  00:33:37.039 suktum has been powerful after some
		  00:33:38.960 point she will appear and she will tell
		  00:33:40.960 them in so and so manantra in so and so
		  00:33:43.840 samwatsara in so and so ayana in so and
		  00:33:46.399 so paka in so and so masa and so and so
		  00:33:48.799 titi in so and so nakhatra at so and so
		  00:33:51.279 time you will leave your body now when
		  00:33:54.399 you leave your body these are all the
		  00:33:56.000 locoms that are available for you which
		  00:33:58.080 one do you want a true bhta will say I
		  00:34:01.200 don't want any of those i want you then
		  00:34:02.640 she'll pull him into herself that is
		  00:34:04.760 ratri but now please don't go looking
		  00:34:07.120 for which ratrium this is can I also
		  00:34:09.280 start to chant this from today because
		  00:34:11.119 the objective is not the palam she gives
		  00:34:13.280 the objective is ratrium is that
		  00:34:15.599 powerful but in the vedams there are
		  00:34:18.000 nyamas there are rules involved there
		  00:34:19.760 are saras there are a host of
		  00:34:21.199 complications in this book the ratri
		  00:34:24.399 suktum that brahadeva gives us everybody
		  00:34:26.960 can read that is the beauty of chundi
		  00:34:29.520 satashati on one side there is the
		  00:34:31.760 sananea there is the context on the
		  00:34:34.159 other side there is the stuti there are
		  00:34:36.719 four phenomenal stouties that come in
		  00:34:39.520 this entire 700 shloka series the first
		  00:34:42.639 one comes in pratamacharitra in chapter
		  00:34:44.879 one this one is called as brahadeva kra
		  00:34:48.719 ka means recited by or created by Brahma
		  00:34:52.320 Ratri totrram this is the first one the
		  00:34:54.719 second one will come in chapter four
		  00:34:56.639 five and then 11 so together these four
		  00:34:59.920 are the essence of satashati because we
		  00:35:01.839 can quickly tell the story and move on
		  00:35:03.599 but if we miss what is being told over
		  00:35:05.760 here we will not be able to understand
		  00:35:07.760 what is so powerful about this and look
		  00:35:09.839 at the context here is karta brahma is
		  00:35:12.960 karta he is doing suktum he is doing a
		  00:35:15.520 stotrum and he's saying to the one who
		  00:35:18.240 is swadha to the one who is swaha to the
		  00:35:21.520 one who is saratika to the one who is
		  00:35:24.760 adhantatra to her I bow down and he goes
		  00:35:28.079 on this stotrum is incredibly beautiful
		  00:35:30.240 I will not go into each portion of the
		  00:35:32.320 stotrum in the interest of time but if
		  00:35:33.920 we do not touch the stotrum at all it
		  00:35:36.079 will be anaam to people who are sitting
		  00:35:37.839 here who do chandi sathati parana often
		  00:35:40.000 so for their sake at least we have to
		  00:35:42.400 take the pearls of a few shloka comes
		  00:35:44.960 from here and this is the beauty the
		  00:35:47.599 idea of chundi yagnum of chundi hom that
		  00:35:50.400 people do this is a chundi hom that we
		  00:35:52.720 are doing for the next 3 days because
		  00:35:54.400 when you do something and you listen to
		  00:35:56.079 it with that power it enters into the
		  00:35:58.640 body with that same force and then it
		  00:36:00.800 becomes a yagnam that yagnam is what we
		  00:36:03.280 are trying to do trying to understand
		  00:36:05.280 what is this totrum that he made and
		  00:36:07.280 what is so extraordinary about it so the
		  00:36:09.920 first verse that he talks about is what
		  00:36:12.960 I says toam swaha
		  00:36:15.280 He begins with a very interesting
		  00:36:16.720 concept he says swaha and swadahada have
		  00:36:18.800 you heard these words
		  00:36:22.280 anywhere when we perform
		  00:36:25.160 a samboma it is swaha if it is a pitra
		  00:36:29.240 samba we use the word swadha right here
		  00:36:33.680 what brahmadea says is you are the one
		  00:36:36.800 who is taking so what we mean by swaha
		  00:36:39.040 and swadha is swaha and swadha are two
		  00:36:41.119 forces two shakis when we say the word
		  00:36:44.079 swaha indra swaha it means oh swaha dvi
		  00:36:47.839 please take this and please give it to
		  00:36:49.880 Indra you say this for pitra devatas and
		  00:36:52.560 you say swadha swadha is that force who
		  00:36:54.560 will go and transfer it over there it is
		  00:36:56.320 the divine postal system you can say so
		  00:36:59.119 swaha and swadha are both forces you are
		  00:37:03.599 those forces you are swarat mika so
		  00:37:07.280 through swaha and swadha he's telling
		  00:37:08.800 you about yagnam and yagnam happens
		  00:37:10.880 through what it happens through mantrum
		  00:37:12.400 Mantrum depends on what swaram because
		  00:37:14.560 you have to pronounce that you have to
		  00:37:15.920 say it in the right swaram so when
		  00:37:18.240 people are saying something in a ynam
		  00:37:20.160 that is also you what they are offering
		  00:37:22.079 inside that is also you the one who
		  00:37:24.160 pulls that out and says yes I will go
		  00:37:25.839 and give it to that respective dwata
		  00:37:27.839 that is also you and then he says you
		  00:37:30.800 are that swarathika and you are that
		  00:37:33.359 ardam matra you are the source from
		  00:37:35.760 where all this began look at this beauty
		  00:37:38.400 he's talking about yagnam the sound or
		  00:37:41.520 the the power of sound that we use in a
		  00:37:44.160 yagnam and goes back to sound and says
		  00:37:46.720 you are the original primordial sound
		  00:37:49.280 which is omara brahadeva is giving the
		  00:37:52.160 reverse order of sishi sishi starts with
		  00:37:54.720 omcaram with pranavam from pranavam came
		  00:37:58.400 the trigonas from the trigonunas came
		  00:38:00.640 the punchabhas from the punchabhutas
		  00:38:02.560 came the swishi from the sishi came
		  00:38:04.640 yagny from yagnyam we again go back to
		  00:38:06.640 dvatas he gave the reverse disorder here
		  00:38:08.960 so this shlokum is very very beautiful
		  00:38:11.040 and as he goes on Brahma understands who
		  00:38:13.920 he's doing stuti to that is the beauty
		  00:38:15.680 of the shlokum he says one thing he says
		  00:38:18.359 mahadevi now comes the title song
		  00:38:21.119 mahadvi he said this is called dvi
		  00:38:23.320 mahatma so the word dvi is a very very
		  00:38:26.880 interesting word i'll come to that later
		  00:38:30.079 mahadevi great goddess mahasuri i'll
		  00:38:33.359 break it down mahasuri what does it mean
		  00:38:38.000 great
		  00:38:38.839 Raashasi Brahma Deva knows who he's
		  00:38:40.960 doing stuti to and he just says great
		  00:38:42.960 goddess great
		  00:38:45.160 raasi this is where chandi mahhatnyam
		  00:38:48.240 begins dvi mahaam begins here when we
		  00:38:51.119 look at this
		  00:38:52.119 universe for us the way we are
		  00:38:55.200 comfortable thinking is di is only
		  00:38:56.960 giving us happy wonderful experiences no
		  00:39:01.760 not what sanatana dharma says sanatana
		  00:39:04.160 dharma is saying she's there in the
		  00:39:05.680 beautiful she's there In the ugly she's
		  00:39:07.680 there in the good she's there in the bad
		  00:39:10.160 what the shis that support you dwatas
		  00:39:12.560 the shis that oppose you raasas this is
		  00:39:15.119 how we think if you don't like someone
		  00:39:16.560 we'll
		  00:39:17.800 say
		  00:39:19.720 oh buddhi she's there in both sanata is
		  00:39:24.800 not telling you only in the lovely
		  00:39:26.560 things she's there inishi whatever
		  00:39:29.040 brings us joy whatever brings us
		  00:39:32.240 happiness we call as a because it's not
		  00:39:34.480 threatening us whatever we don't like
		  00:39:36.720 whatever we feel repelled by we call it
		  00:39:38.480 as gora but is
		  00:39:44.359 both so what is the point of this tot
		  00:39:47.359 the point of this totrum is
		  00:39:49.359 acknowledgment in our lives that the
		  00:39:52.160 pleasant and the unpleasant both are you
		  00:39:54.480 you are there in the unpleasant moments
		  00:39:56.560 also if I am experiencing something
		  00:39:59.200 unpleasant amma you are there what
		  00:40:02.000 happens to a person who sees her in both
		  00:40:04.079 these states know is that she takes you
		  00:40:06.160 beyond both of them that's one second is
		  00:40:09.760 when you see her in an unpleasant
		  00:40:12.040 experience you will bow down to that
		  00:40:14.400 unpleasant experience and say this is
		  00:40:16.240 also you but don't harm me then she will
		  00:40:19.599 not harm you through that unpleasant
		  00:40:21.119 experience many of you would be familiar
		  00:40:23.200 with the rdrum the rudra namakam in the
		  00:40:25.920 rdra namakam mantras one entire anuakam
		  00:40:28.800 is dedicated to rdra who is in the form
		  00:40:30.960 of thieves and vedam has done so much
		  00:40:33.280 research on this it says to Rdra who is
		  00:40:35.520 in the form of thieves who steal
		  00:40:36.640 occasionally to Rudra who is in the form
		  00:40:38.079 of thieves who steal regularly to Rdra
		  00:40:39.839 who is in the form of thieves that come
		  00:40:41.040 at night come at day who are near me all
		  00:40:44.079 of them the rudram is doing a namaskarum
		  00:40:46.400 to thieves to burglars to murderers why
		  00:40:49.920 because it's accepting that they're
		  00:40:51.119 there in this universe they will always
		  00:40:52.640 be there but when you do a namaskarum to
		  00:40:54.800 rdra or to dvi if she's there in the
		  00:40:58.000 that form she will not harm you that is
		  00:41:00.000 the reason you do a namaskarum and say
		  00:41:01.839 mahadevi mahasuri you are mahasuri don't
		  00:41:04.960 harm me as mahasuri that is all I ask
		  00:41:06.960 you for so he goes on with this stotrum
		  00:41:11.359 and he says one beautiful line in this
		  00:41:13.520 he says amma we are all deluded by your
		  00:41:17.119 power because of your power vishnu is
		  00:41:19.280 sleeping madu and kitabha have come now
		  00:41:22.000 they're attacking me praadama jagat
		  00:41:24.560 swami let that jagat swami wake up
		  00:41:27.440 because only if you leave his body can
		  00:41:29.599 he wake up only if he wakes up can he
		  00:41:31.920 kill Madu and Kaitaba So do that and as
		  00:41:35.280 soon as he says this the stotrum
		  00:41:38.240 finishes and from Vishnu's eyes first
		  00:41:41.119 thing they mention is from Vishnu's eyes
		  00:41:42.880 because the opening of eyes is always
		  00:41:44.880 symbolic of Srishti that is what we see
		  00:41:47.119 in the case of life as well right we
		  00:41:49.119 wait for people to open their eyes to
		  00:41:51.040 count that as the beginning of life we
		  00:41:53.119 wait even in a painting if you look at
		  00:41:55.680 mural Kerala murals and even when the
		  00:41:57.680 dura idols are made in Bengal it is the
		  00:41:59.920 nonrron millinum the the dot that is put
		  00:42:02.240 into the eye That is counted because
		  00:42:04.000 from then the vigraham has pranam
		  00:42:05.760 opening of eyes all her work is with
		  00:42:08.240 eyes only that's why they called her
		  00:42:09.440 kamaki minaki vishal aakshi shataki
		  00:42:11.960 dvyakshi any ashi ashi that shi is all
		  00:42:16.000 in the eyes so the first place she
		  00:42:18.400 leaves is his eyes so his eyes wake up
		  00:42:20.160 that's how you recognize that somebody
		  00:42:21.280 is awake so now from his eyes from his
		  00:42:24.079 hayam from his ears from his nasikum all
		  00:42:27.599 those parts she leaves and now vishnu
		  00:42:30.400 stirs when vishnu stirs into action
		  00:42:33.760 immediately he looks and he sees Madhu
		  00:42:36.160 and Kaidabha he sees Brahma who is in
		  00:42:39.240 deep agitation but is Brahma in
		  00:42:42.720 agitation brahma made a stuti she came
		  00:42:45.440 and answered that she left now Vishnu
		  00:42:48.720 looked at Madu and Kaitaba and he said
		  00:42:51.680 "Okay let's have a war." So this is what
		  00:42:54.960 Madu and Kataba wanted they're so happy
		  00:42:58.079 and this war is going on not one day two
		  00:43:00.480 day three day like our discourse 5,000
		  00:43:03.839 years it went on for now brahma thought
		  00:43:07.440 to himself this you don't find in the
		  00:43:09.040 chandias you find it in another puranam
		  00:43:11.680 that
		  00:43:12.520 says when it had to start for him to
		  00:43:15.599 wake up Vishnu he needed her help now
		  00:43:18.240 for this task to find completion also he
		  00:43:20.400 needs her help again so he prays again
		  00:43:22.480 to her and he says amma do something so
		  00:43:24.480 that the war finishes for any of us when
		  00:43:27.040 we take up a task we take it up with the
		  00:43:29.599 intention that the task should complete
		  00:43:31.200 nobody enjoys continuing the task
		  00:43:32.720 forever and ever the point is it should
		  00:43:34.960 reach that point of completion so in
		  00:43:38.480 this moment 5,000 years have passed and
		  00:43:41.280 suddenly something happens not to Vishnu
		  00:43:43.440 vishnu is continuing to fight brahma is
		  00:43:46.280 concerned by I have to create Sishi this
		  00:43:49.839 Vishnu is busy here with this so please
		  00:43:52.240 let something happen and something
		  00:43:54.079 extraordinary happens madu and Kaitaba
		  00:43:56.720 look at each other and say papa
		  00:44:00.280 now two of us one of him shall we give
		  00:44:04.000 him one
		  00:44:05.240 blessing for people who are fighting for
		  00:44:07.839 5,000 years nothing happened suddenly in
		  00:44:10.880 one moment they're thinking to
		  00:44:12.760 themselves papa so sad
		  00:44:16.599 mahaya you think ah I'm so great look at
		  00:44:20.000 both of us no ah what can I do for you
		  00:44:23.359 that feeling of superiority when it
		  00:44:25.200 comes No it means she has deluded you
		  00:44:28.000 that is why there is a very beautiful
		  00:44:29.760 shlokum here that comes a very important
		  00:44:32.160 shlokum that
		  00:44:34.599 says Sumedha says the shlokum why
		  00:44:37.359 because Surata said we are we
		  00:44:41.480 areanis and
		  00:44:46.440 says baladrisha moaya mahamaya prihati
		  00:44:51.119 to people who declare yes I am ai
		  00:44:53.440 nothing bothers me to them she will say
		  00:44:55.920 oh really and she will put that maya
		  00:44:58.960 that mayapasham is so strong that you
		  00:45:01.359 will get pulled by it nobody
		  00:45:05.079 Ready moa she pulls it strength she's
		  00:45:08.960 the real shapova okay she has
		  00:45:10.880 extraordinary strength and nobody can
		  00:45:12.960 resist that pull baladada moaya mahaya
		  00:45:16.640 prihati she will test and see let me see
		  00:45:19.040 how much maya you have truly gone over
		  00:45:22.319 so Madhu and kitabha completely deluded
		  00:45:25.359 by her maya saying ask for a boon
		  00:45:28.000 imagine the arrogance to look at
		  00:45:30.160 paramatma and say you ask for a boon
		  00:45:32.319 it's not with love it's with arrogance
		  00:45:34.240 that they do it so Paramatma if you
		  00:45:36.319 think you are Maidhavi he's Mahamehavi
		  00:45:38.960 so Mahamehavi responds and he says okay
		  00:45:41.359 you want to give me a boon no Vishnu
		  00:45:43.440 didn't say you think you'll give me a
		  00:45:45.119 boon you know who I
		  00:45:46.599 am no he said okay give me a boon this
		  00:45:50.440 isma you should die in my
		  00:45:53.560 hands they asked for their own death but
		  00:45:57.440 Rajo Gddhi and Tamabuddhi you know they
		  00:45:59.680 keep working constantly round the clock
		  00:46:02.640 they get best performance award also in
		  00:46:05.839 any company because they're constantly
		  00:46:07.359 working without a break so Rajabudi
		  00:46:10.000 immediately they look around when I
		  00:46:11.920 describe the scene to you what did I say
		  00:46:13.280 is there all
		  00:46:14.520 around water
		  00:46:16.839 jalam so immediately okay we can die at
		  00:46:20.400 your hands but you should kill us in a
		  00:46:22.480 place where there is no
		  00:46:26.720 Vishnu said tatasu vishnu became big
		  00:46:29.280 took Madu and Kaitaba put him put them
		  00:46:31.280 on his thighs and with the sudasha
		  00:46:33.280 chakra end of story this is the pratama
		  00:46:36.440 chararitra we'll go home
		  00:46:39.160 now why is this story being told let's
		  00:46:43.040 look at the beautiful analogies here
		  00:46:45.599 what names what did I say one raasha's
		  00:46:48.000 name is one is kitabha what is the other
		  00:46:49.440 one have you heard this name how many of
		  00:46:51.599 you are familiar with Vishnu asamu
		  00:46:54.880 there are some names there's some don't
		  00:46:56.880 worry even if you're not I'll build the
		  00:46:58.800 context but if you're familiar you'll
		  00:47:00.240 catch on to this the word madu comes a
		  00:47:03.839 minimum of three times in the sahastra
		  00:47:06.359 madhavo
		  00:47:08.119 Madu Madhav
		  00:47:10.200 Madhusana Madhavo also comes so but I'll
		  00:47:14.960 come total in a minute madu and
		  00:47:17.800 Madhusana vishnu killed this raasa
		  00:47:20.400 called Madu so he is Madhu Sudhana
		  00:47:22.319 correct
		  00:47:23.680 but then we are calling him Madu what
		  00:47:26.319 does that mean the same sahasam says
		  00:47:28.880 that you killed Madu oh by the way you
		  00:47:30.640 are also Madu just same name it's like
		  00:47:33.200 two
		  00:47:34.040 Shinas that's all it means you're
		  00:47:36.319 Shinasra who killed
		  00:47:38.359 Shinasra sahastra Nam we are not reading
		  00:47:40.880 it like that we're not pausing to think
		  00:47:42.640 why is the same name coming in
		  00:47:44.240 absolutely contradicting contexts
		  00:47:46.880 because here let's look at this
		  00:47:48.960 beautiful nomomenclature
		  00:47:51.359 madu means what honey honey's nature is
		  00:47:55.680 what what how does it taste we're all
		  00:47:58.160 agreeing on that so in Ayurveda anything
		  00:48:02.880 that is sweet anything that is
		  00:48:05.280 moderately sweet is considered as satic
		  00:48:08.800 if it becomes hyper sweet means you put
		  00:48:11.680 1 kg of sugar into something that
		  00:48:13.440 doesn't need it it becomes
		  00:48:15.400 tamasic so madu becomes deeply tamasic
		  00:48:20.640 now look at this concept of madru one
		  00:48:24.480 drop of honey you
		  00:48:26.040 put on the ground in two minutes from
		  00:48:29.599 directions you wouldn't have imagined
		  00:48:30.960 ants will comeas will
		  00:48:34.839 come many many many many insects around
		  00:48:37.680 them are personified as one kita this is
		  00:48:41.280 also beautifully interpreted as madu is
		  00:48:44.240 the sweetness of I saying me when you
		  00:48:47.839 have one I you will have many mice is I
		  00:48:50.880 I am so and so my family my children my
		  00:48:54.640 my bank account my job my security my
		  00:48:57.359 this all those my my my are all kaka
		  00:49:00.559 combinedly called as kitabha so madhu
		  00:49:02.960 and kitabha are aham and mama this is
		  00:49:06.960 all mine mind these are all those
		  00:49:08.960 insects that come now this is one
		  00:49:11.280 interpretation but madhu is honey which
		  00:49:14.160 insect comes around honey typically the
		  00:49:16.960 bee have you ever seen the bee quietly
		  00:49:19.880 sitting it's buzzing all the time if
		  00:49:22.400 madu is that tamasa that hyper sweet
		  00:49:27.480 honey that bee is the buzzing kit what
		  00:49:31.280 should we do what should we do what
		  00:49:32.240 should we do my mind is not happy my
		  00:49:34.000 mind is not happy my mind is not happy
		  00:49:35.440 it doesn't let the mind sit down this is
		  00:49:38.319 rajogunam and tamogunam so it is
		  00:49:41.119 tamogunam that started this whole thing
		  00:49:44.480 and to remove tamogum dvi had to come as
		  00:49:47.599 maha tamasaki that maha
		  00:49:50.359 tamasaki we didn't give her a name only
		  00:49:52.559 till now we just said nidra dvi that
		  00:49:55.119 maha tamasashaki who left vishnu's body
		  00:49:58.240 came as mahakali that is the
		  00:50:00.920 pratamacharitam over here that within us
		  00:50:03.359 when that tamogam comes that dya
		  00:50:06.000 tamogunam will come and say you think
		  00:50:07.839 you know it all look at me and look at
		  00:50:09.920 what I'm capable of look at how you are
		  00:50:12.160 under my control and I will delude you
		  00:50:15.280 to your own end we have a very beautiful
		  00:50:17.280 saying in samskritam which is vinakal
		  00:50:19.119 vipa buddhi some people they don't even
		  00:50:22.000 realize it they do stupid things leading
		  00:50:24.240 to their own downfall this happens
		  00:50:26.880 especially you'll notice this to people
		  00:50:28.559 that are drunk with power this is
		  00:50:31.119 because she deludes them saying yeah you
		  00:50:33.119 think it's your calam it's working this
		  00:50:35.280 is exactly what happened to Rahana
		  00:50:36.960 exactly what happened to Kumbakarna
		  00:50:38.480 deluded by power you don't recognize
		  00:50:40.559 what that arrogance is doing to you but
		  00:50:43.599 in this mind in this case Maduka is
		  00:50:46.800 separate brahma is separate but in our
		  00:50:48.640 case all three are in one place so when
		  00:50:51.119 these things are going on Brahma alone
		  00:50:54.400 Satwa buddhi alone has the power to say
		  00:50:57.119 amma please protect me my mind is going
		  00:50:59.680 amma somewhere my mind is getting
		  00:51:02.160 distracted my mind is becoming arrogant
		  00:51:04.160 stop it then she will come and do her
		  00:51:06.000 job this is beautifully shown in
		  00:51:09.000 Mahakaliram now I will go back to what I
		  00:51:12.079 said about three names madhavu
		  00:51:16.200 Mahavus
		  00:51:18.200 Madavat why are we using the words Madu
		  00:51:21.839 and Madhusana madhusana is you destroy
		  00:51:25.839 this
		  00:51:26.920 Aamhava you make me recognize that there
		  00:51:30.000 is only one joy in this universe and
		  00:51:33.359 that is Brahmanandam
		  00:51:35.640 anand and that joy is the truest sweet
		  00:51:39.520 that we can experience that is madhu as
		  00:51:41.680 narayana so madusana on one hand but
		  00:51:44.480 that madhava is also madu who does he do
		  00:51:47.119 this for only if you go to him and pray
		  00:51:49.920 with that heart saying remove these
		  00:51:51.599 things i'm tormented by samsara i'm
		  00:51:54.079 deluded by all these forces then he will
		  00:51:57.520 become salah for you and then do this
		  00:52:00.240 that's
		  00:52:03.319 why it actually comes in the reverse
		  00:52:05.359 order first
		  00:52:06.680 comes then
		  00:52:08.520 comes but for that to happen you have to
		  00:52:11.839 ask because until you ask nobody will
		  00:52:14.960 give that exactly is what happened in
		  00:52:17.040 Arjunaish yogam also one whole chapter
		  00:52:19.760 he went on Krishna listened patiently
		  00:52:22.079 finally he said Krishna what should I do
		  00:52:24.480 here also Surata and Samadhi finally
		  00:52:26.800 they asked after saying we're very
		  00:52:28.800 extraordinary Gyanis when they said what
		  00:52:31.200 should we do then he started a guru will
		  00:52:34.079 not tell you what to do until you ask
		  00:52:38.160 this is the first brahadeva until he
		  00:52:41.359 asked that did not happen until that
		  00:52:44.000 stuti came she didn't come she didn't
		  00:52:45.760 just come and say yeah do does anybody
		  00:52:47.280 need me because that is divinity
		  00:52:49.440 divinity is always around but it's
		  00:52:51.200 waiting for you to make the first move
		  00:52:53.760 so In that beautiful beautiful context
		  00:52:56.240 Mahakali Charitram comes to a conclusion
		  00:52:59.119 now as Mahakali Charitram comes to a
		  00:53:01.400 conclusion I said in the beginning that
		  00:53:03.839 these are three personal stories that
		  00:53:05.680 he's telling this story is for both of
		  00:53:08.559 them together this story is because he's
		  00:53:12.000 telling them you both are deluded by
		  00:53:14.480 that same power that power is deluding
		  00:53:16.880 the dvatas it's deluding the raasas so
		  00:53:19.920 will it not delude you that power is
		  00:53:22.000 making you think samadhi that power is
		  00:53:23.920 making you think oh it's my family but
		  00:53:26.160 papa at the end of the day they're my
		  00:53:27.599 folks that is that power this is not
		  00:53:29.760 your true family your true bandu is your
		  00:53:31.760 atma bandandhu and surata you think
		  00:53:34.880 you're so concerned about your elephant
		  00:53:36.559 sitting over there this is typically
		  00:53:38.400 seen with people who get separated from
		  00:53:40.400 their loved ones I don't know if my
		  00:53:42.240 child in the US has eaten or not poor
		  00:53:44.400 fellow it's been 3 days since he called
		  00:53:46.800 nicely he'll be parking so you don't
		  00:53:49.359 need to have bonds
		  00:53:51.040 that will bind you and keep you stuck
		  00:53:53.040 there those are necessary but they are
		  00:53:55.760 necessary up to a point so this is what
		  00:53:58.240 he's telling them saying there is a
		  00:53:59.680 cosmic power so if you get deluded also
		  00:54:01.920 no recognize that Maya is working inside
		  00:54:04.160 you that Maya is so beautiful that she
		  00:54:07.839 doesn't keep doing this she doesn't keep
		  00:54:09.680 she's not a cruel torturing her nature
		  00:54:13.599 is not this because that maya is
		  00:54:16.160 extremely kind but that maya is also
		  00:54:18.640 extremely intelligent she knows what to
		  00:54:21.040 do with who I've given this example many
		  00:54:23.520 many times earlier and I'll give it
		  00:54:24.720 again because it's relevant now there is
		  00:54:26.720 someone who is frying
		  00:54:28.040 vas so once she places the batter into
		  00:54:30.960 the hot oil she continues to fry now
		  00:54:34.720 some vas she'll take out some will
		  00:54:36.559 remain inside which ones will she take
		  00:54:39.920 The ones that are ripe or the ones that
		  00:54:42.000 are cooked which ones will she
		  00:54:44.200 leave the ones that are raw that is
		  00:54:46.880 exactly what Mahammaya is doing she's
		  00:54:49.200 keeping us all in samsara and as long as
		  00:54:52.960 we need to get cooked and to get that
		  00:54:55.440 firmness of character we will remain
		  00:54:57.119 here the second she recognizes now this
		  00:54:59.040 being he's done because he said amma
		  00:55:01.680 take me into you she'll take that v out
		  00:55:03.280 and she'll keep it so now whether you
		  00:55:04.960 remember anything else or not you will
		  00:55:06.319 think of mahamaya next time you eat a
		  00:55:08.000 vada I'm glad that bhavam she is frying
		  00:55:12.400 us in this cauldron called kalam the
		  00:55:16.079 cauldron itself is time the oil is the
		  00:55:19.200 experiences the experiences are burning
		  00:55:21.200 us it's hot oil she's burning us again
		  00:55:23.920 and again and again and again inside
		  00:55:25.839 that same thing until we show signs of
		  00:55:29.520 readiness saying now I have understood
		  00:55:31.839 I'm cooked I'm ready to go on surah Sata
		  00:55:34.160 and samadhi are being given their first
		  00:55:36.319 sesh saying don't get so attached
		  00:55:40.240 because when you do you will remain in
		  00:55:42.800 this chakr until you seek escaping
		  00:55:45.839 sounds like Bhagavat Gita only no it is
		  00:55:48.480 Bhagavat Gita that is why so from here
		  00:55:51.359 starts another extraordinary charitra
		  00:55:54.280 this particular stot this particular
		  00:55:56.880 charitram is just one it's one chapter
		  00:56:01.040 the split of Chandi Mahaam is very
		  00:56:03.119 interesting it is three chhatrams the
		  00:56:06.000 first is Mahakali now if you pay
		  00:56:08.640 attention to the story Mahakali does not
		  00:56:10.400 make a physical appearance at all at all
		  00:56:13.200 there is a dhana shlokum that comes at
		  00:56:14.880 the beginning of the charitram
		  00:56:16.000 describing her form but that dhanlo does
		  00:56:18.319 not belong to the actual Mahatma it is
		  00:56:21.119 it comes from certain tantric shastras
		  00:56:23.599 that are placed there then for every
		  00:56:25.119 chapter also you have a danishlo but
		  00:56:27.280 that is an upasana prria that is a a
		  00:56:30.160 context pertaining to when you worship
		  00:56:32.640 then why did Mahakali's name come here
		  00:56:34.799 so Mahakali Mahalakshmi and Mahasaras
		  00:56:39.200 Swati these are the three davies that
		  00:56:41.520 whose charitras we are learning
		  00:56:43.400 about but either I've just scammed you
		  00:56:45.760 terribly because I just told you
		  00:56:46.960 Mahakali Charitram and Mahakali didn't
		  00:56:48.720 come or the Puranaveta has a different
		  00:56:52.000 idea of who Mahakali is so they chose to
		  00:56:55.040 name this portion as Mahakali Charitram
		  00:56:57.280 and the next portion they chose to name
		  00:56:59.200 as Mahalakshmi Charitum so look at this
		  00:57:01.680 beautiful karma okay this beautiful
		  00:57:03.359 order Mahakali Mahalakmi Mahasarasati on
		  00:57:06.880 day three we will decode why this
		  00:57:09.599 sequence was chosen the first one is
		  00:57:11.839 just one chapter the next one is chapter
		  00:57:15.200 2 three and four of the book the last
		  00:57:18.400 one that is mahasarasuti charitramum is
		  00:57:21.440 chapter 5 to about chapter 11 12 and 13
		  00:57:24.559 are the palesis so it is effectively
		  00:57:27.520 about six chapters long so 1 3 and then
		  00:57:30.559 six the structure is very very different
		  00:57:33.520 the objective is Gita also he could have
		  00:57:37.200 finished in one sentence saying you are
		  00:57:39.359 not the doer you just do quietly anyway
		  00:57:41.040 they will die but he took 700
		  00:57:43.720 shlokas because the human mind keeps
		  00:57:46.480 returning to the same thing it's our
		  00:57:48.720 nature is to sit process something go
		  00:57:51.920 back into samsara and again get stuck
		  00:57:54.160 into the same thing that is the vada
		  00:57:55.920 being cooked okay and that keeps
		  00:57:58.319 happening repeatedly so there are times
		  00:58:01.119 when a guru will expand the same thing
		  00:58:03.520 and it is summed that he had wonderful
		  00:58:06.319 shishas because when he sat down for the
		  00:58:07.920 next story they'll not be liked and g
		  00:58:11.119 you tell something else now because
		  00:58:13.200 sometimes the same lessons need to go
		  00:58:15.280 back in the same foundations have to be
		  00:58:17.680 res resorted saying okay I know this but
		  00:58:20.079 am I feeling it I know it's mahammaya
		  00:58:22.319 but I'm not feeling it sometimes that
		  00:58:24.160 may not be soles sometimes the rahasams
		  00:58:27.200 go deeper that is why this charitram was
		  00:58:29.920 for both of them together saying maya is
		  00:58:32.240 deluding you do a namaskarum to that
		  00:58:34.640 maya she will not delude you the second
		  00:58:37.760 is this story is for a king that king
		  00:58:42.079 who was thrown out of his own kingdom so
		  00:58:45.280 the story starts off with a rashasa
		  00:58:48.240 called Mahishasur mahasura took Indra's
		  00:58:50.720 throne that's how the story begins here
		  00:58:53.119 is something interesting because this
		  00:58:55.319 story is mirroring what the king is
		  00:58:57.920 going through through this
		  00:58:59.880 message surata is being told this keeps
		  00:59:03.280 happening this is the nature of royalty
		  00:59:05.359 this is the nature of politics any
		  00:59:07.440 public profession will see you at its
		  00:59:09.440 peak at some time then someone else will
		  00:59:11.200 replace you then there will be a tussle
		  00:59:13.359 it's what happens at a cosmic level it's
		  00:59:15.200 what happens at a praancha level as well
		  00:59:17.520 don't get so affected by it that is his
		  00:59:19.680 first message to him and he begins this
		  00:59:21.920 beautiful charitram now the interesting
		  00:59:24.079 thing here is is it is Maha Lakshmi
		  00:59:26.319 Charatam but this is not Vishnu Pakni
		  00:59:29.119 Lakshmi that comes here but we'll decode
		  00:59:31.440 this later i know I'm saying that a lot
		  00:59:33.040 but I'm keeping note of what all I'm
		  00:59:34.400 saying this for so begins the story a
		  00:59:37.680 very very well-known story but our
		  00:59:40.640 objective for the next three days is to
		  00:59:43.119 take the well-known aspects the
		  00:59:45.520 well-known stories and find the lesserk
		  00:59:47.359 known aspects in them the the joy is
		  00:59:49.920 most of us are familiar with this
		  00:59:51.839 because we we know the idea of dura
		  00:59:54.000 killing Mahishasur it is a very
		  00:59:55.200 well-known concept but the story has so
		  00:59:58.000 many points that we will pause and we
		  01:00:00.559 will look at because I want to give this
		  01:00:02.480 disclaimer now i will not be spending
		  01:00:04.640 time on every minute in the war because
		  01:00:07.280 that is known to us of how she
		  01:00:09.359 ultimately kills him but what are the
		  01:00:12.000 circumstances that lead to the arrival
		  01:00:14.319 of divinity that is what we have to look
		  01:00:16.400 out for because if we look out for that
		  01:00:19.200 that is a possibility in our own lives
		  01:00:20.960 saying "Oh and under these circumstances
		  01:00:23.359 in my journey in my personal journey God
		  01:00:26.799 will come for me." That is the
		  01:00:28.640 reassurance that a bakta is being given
		  01:00:31.200 so when the tables turn on your fortune
		  01:00:34.720 if you are in a terrible state this
		  01:00:37.359 story comes for you that is what he's
		  01:00:39.359 telling him he's telling him a story
		  01:00:41.280 imagine somebody who's gone and said
		  01:00:42.400 "They've thrown me out of the house."
		  01:00:43.359 When you're telling him a story you're
		  01:00:45.119 telling him not a jakata it is not a
		  01:00:47.920 story that is powerless it is Brahma it
		  01:00:51.520 is brahakata parab brahakata is
		  01:00:54.559 vibrating with chaitanya that's why I
		  01:00:56.400 said we're sitting here knowingly or
		  01:00:58.400 unknowingly we are visualizing these
		  01:00:59.920 scenes knowingly or unknowingly it is a
		  01:01:01.680 chandiam only that is happening so
		  01:01:03.520 whatever happened there for Surata and
		  01:01:05.200 Samadhi for Brahma and now for Indra and
		  01:01:07.760 the other datas that can happen for us
		  01:01:09.920 all we have to do is listen so
		  01:01:12.319 Mahishasra has taken over Indra loca
		  01:01:15.040 once Mahishasra has taken Indra loca
		  01:01:17.520 Indra comes to Brahma indra Agni Vuna
		  01:01:21.359 Vayu all of them go to Brahma they go to
		  01:01:24.880 praapati the word used in this portion
		  01:01:27.760 of the satashati is praapati praapati
		  01:01:31.119 here refers to the mind what this means
		  01:01:34.079 is all the gods are responsible for
		  01:01:37.359 different functions in the mind
		  01:01:39.200 different functions in the body all the
		  01:01:41.559 indrias are governed by different dvatas
		  01:01:44.559 the ruler of all of them is called as
		  01:01:46.240 Indra so one god for speech one god for
		  01:01:48.799 our sight one god for our touch and so
		  01:01:50.880 on and so forth all of these have been
		  01:01:53.760 taken over by
		  01:01:55.960 who who is
		  01:01:58.440 Mahesa
		  01:02:00.040 buffalo that is his actual name that
		  01:02:02.400 only they gave it any mother will
		  01:02:04.880 actually name her child
		  01:02:09.680 what is the Quranic terminology why the
		  01:02:11.920 problem is we're not pausing to think
		  01:02:13.200 about that why have they taken the name
		  01:02:15.760 of a buffalo not difficult at all to
		  01:02:18.480 understand have you ever tried to cross
		  01:02:19.760 the road and seen a buffalo there have
		  01:02:21.839 you tried to cross a buffalo you know
		  01:02:24.160 what will happen you will have to move
		  01:02:25.520 the buffalo will not move
		  01:02:27.960 inertia inertia has taken over the whole
		  01:02:30.839 body that inertia is mahisha it is not a
		  01:02:35.359 disrespect to the animal jati they have
		  01:02:37.280 taken that quality of an animal and they
		  01:02:39.680 have built it as a metaphor for
		  01:02:41.119 something that inertia has acquired an
		  01:02:45.160 assuri what this means is inertia means
		  01:02:48.079 it'll sit right there you have to move
		  01:02:49.440 i'll not move that is
		  01:02:51.480 inertia assur buddhi means I care about
		  01:02:54.640 me and myself the only objective of me
		  01:02:57.520 living is I should be happy i don't give
		  01:02:59.119 a I don't give anything any concern to
		  01:03:01.440 anyone else that is assuri all of us
		  01:03:04.720 have it at some point when we're
		  01:03:05.920 obsessed with our earnings our life I
		  01:03:07.920 should be happy i don't care even if I
		  01:03:09.680 upset him by saying this I'll say it but
		  01:03:11.200 I should be happy that is
		  01:03:12.680 assura imagine these two things together
		  01:03:15.599 one in buffalo thinking I should be
		  01:03:18.079 happy no one else on this road should be
		  01:03:19.839 happy that buffalo will wreak havoc in
		  01:03:22.079 your body that is what Mahisha is doing
		  01:03:24.480 so Mahesa has taken over the senses and
		  01:03:27.119 when that that takes over the senses the
		  01:03:29.680 senses are feeling powerless the senses
		  01:03:32.319 are feeling a yoke some senses are also
		  01:03:35.119 being bothered by external and internal
		  01:03:37.119 factors and when this happens what does
		  01:03:40.079 one do one goes to the mind and says I
		  01:03:42.880 don't know what to do the mind is
		  01:03:44.799 praapati brahma deva all the dvatas are
		  01:03:47.280 going to him and saying I don't know
		  01:03:48.720 what to do swami what should we do
		  01:03:51.200 immediately brahma deva says let us go
		  01:03:54.480 and seek a guru that guru if it if
		  01:03:57.920 you're a shiva bhakta it is dakina
		  01:04:00.000 mortah if you're a Vishnu Bhta it is
		  01:04:02.000 Krishna Mand Jagatgurum and the
		  01:04:04.480 interesting thing is in the story they
		  01:04:06.000 go to a place where both the gurus are
		  01:04:07.280 there together shiva and Vishnu both are
		  01:04:09.280 at the same place again Chandi Sati is
		  01:04:12.319 saying don't be obsessed because in this
		  01:04:14.880 point the question is not which Sraaya
		  01:04:17.280 is yours when somebody is sharing
		  01:04:19.079 Bhagavatanam or Bhagavat Kata or
		  01:04:21.200 Bhagavat Yagnyam is happening the first
		  01:04:23.280 question you should not be asking
		  01:04:25.640 is what is happening there is something
		  01:04:28.559 connecting to Paramatma it doesn't
		  01:04:30.079 matter whether it is namaru or not
		  01:04:31.680 namaru and when it comes to paramatma
		  01:04:33.760 the only every baa is namaru that's the
		  01:04:36.240 ultimate message there that is hidden so
		  01:04:38.799 here also this is exactly what's
		  01:04:40.559 happening they go to a place where both
		  01:04:42.160 these gurus are present and now all of
		  01:04:45.839 what Mahishasra has done is being told
		  01:04:48.720 to Vishnu and Shiva that Mahisha has
		  01:04:51.359 taken over Indom that Mahisha has
		  01:04:53.680 stopped dharma replace the words mahisha
		  01:04:57.280 with inertia and sens sensual explosion
		  01:05:02.240 that within the body there is only
		  01:05:04.240 inertia and there is only a desire to
		  01:05:06.400 keep myself happy that has taken over
		  01:05:08.559 the whole body and now there is absolute
		  01:05:12.640 chaos in the body imagine if we lived
		  01:05:14.799 one day in our life like this where we
		  01:05:18.160 don't know what is happening but
		  01:05:19.520 something is going wrong we don't know
		  01:05:21.359 why we are acting a certain way that is
		  01:05:22.799 mishas surah and when that happens all
		  01:05:25.920 of this is being told all the adheras
		  01:05:28.079 that Mahasura is doing is being told
		  01:05:30.960 this is the point we have to hold on
		  01:05:32.160 into in the story when Vishnu and Shiva
		  01:05:34.480 hear this they become angry here is
		  01:05:37.280 something to think about humans means we
		  01:05:39.280 become angry anger is supposed to be
		  01:05:42.359 tanophatru as we say your anger is your
		  01:05:45.039 enemy but here gods are getting angry
		  01:05:47.359 what does this mean the idea that
		  01:05:50.880 adharma makes paramatma angry that if
		  01:05:54.640 that consciousness within us that
		  01:05:57.039 parabrama within us also becomes angry
		  01:06:00.960 this is one aspect second is if you want
		  01:06:04.480 to see the complete expression of
		  01:06:06.720 somebody's power you know when you will
		  01:06:08.880 see it when they are angry because the
		  01:06:12.880 same hand that gently touches you and
		  01:06:14.880 says are you well when it shows its
		  01:06:18.240 complete power is not this is when it
		  01:06:19.920 does this anger is the complete
		  01:06:22.960 expression of shi so now Vishnu and
		  01:06:25.440 Shiva become angry that anger is a dvy
		  01:06:31.200 it is divy in its nature and that copam
		  01:06:35.680 that copam also in samskrum the words
		  01:06:39.839 chanda comes from copa from that dhhatu
		  01:06:42.960 so hence this is called chundi stashati
		  01:06:45.280 but chundi has another meaning which I
		  01:06:47.039 will come to in some time that anger now
		  01:06:49.440 coming back to the story that anger
		  01:06:51.839 starts to come out from Brahma and
		  01:06:54.079 Vishnu so from Vishnu and Shiva and the
		  01:06:56.960 way it comes out is it comes from their
		  01:06:59.760 agna chakrum all of so their eyes are
		  01:07:02.240 closed when they're listening to all of
		  01:07:03.680 what Mahishasura is doing and that makes
		  01:07:06.079 them angry and that anger grows to a
		  01:07:08.160 point that a joti comes out from them
		  01:07:11.520 from Shiva it comes Vishnu's joti also
		  01:07:14.559 comes and lands there and then the
		  01:07:16.160 dvatas realize okay something
		  01:07:17.839 extraordinary is happening we need to
		  01:07:19.520 follow suit so they also close their
		  01:07:21.599 eyes and without them realizing
		  01:07:24.880 The shy that is inside them the complete
		  01:07:27.520 shy that expresses itself as anger comes
		  01:07:30.799 out now and it joins this this is the
		  01:07:34.079 idea have you ever anybody seen anyone
		  01:07:36.559 shaking in anger that's what that power
		  01:07:39.599 is inside the body if it is used for
		  01:07:41.920 right purposes anger is phenomenal that
		  01:07:44.480 is where the anger that you see a a
		  01:07:47.680 harmless indie on the street will not
		  01:07:50.079 touch you on an ordinary day but if you
		  01:07:52.960 try to touch her puppies all the anger
		  01:07:55.920 she has will come out in that moment she
		  01:07:58.000 will not look at her physical strength
		  01:07:59.359 or how frail she is she will come and
		  01:08:01.280 bite you this is that kind of an anger
		  01:08:03.760 the anger that Paramatma has because
		  01:08:05.440 Paramatma's children are being harmed by
		  01:08:07.920 that Mahishasura that anger comes out
		  01:08:10.319 for them and all the devatas from all of
		  01:08:13.039 them their shi is going towards one
		  01:08:15.080 kendrathanam one central point now from
		  01:08:19.198 this came one shy now the beauty is this
		  01:08:23.600 shy that came is an extraordinary shy
		  01:08:27.279 and the way she came she came from all
		  01:08:30.479 of them so was she their daughter does
		  01:08:33.359 she belong to them no mahatma is saying
		  01:08:36.960 the shy that was inside them now came
		  01:08:39.600 outside of them that is why you cannot
		  01:08:41.520 say this goddess has a birth this
		  01:08:43.679 goddess has an arrival she has an entry
		  01:08:46.158 but it's not a birth and from which
		  01:08:49.759 dvata which body part came is described
		  01:08:52.719 here as that joti collectively from all
		  01:08:55.520 theatas sitting in a circle from all of
		  01:08:58.000 them there is one
		  01:09:04.279 jotal is what we say
		  01:09:09.960 inha from locas are covered with that
		  01:09:13.520 light that's how it's beaming and that
		  01:09:16.158 light this portion of Mahatma is a
		  01:09:18.719 dhanam if you close your eyes and you
		  01:09:21.120 visualize it no from this joti punjam
		  01:09:24.238 from this pillar of light a a human or
		  01:09:27.520 it's not right to say human but a divine
		  01:09:29.920 form came into being from head to toe
		  01:09:33.520 which data's energy gave rise to which
		  01:09:35.759 form they have given a detail of and
		  01:09:37.839 what that signifies also they have said
		  01:09:40.319 but we are in navatri there cannot be a
		  01:09:42.880 better time to do a dhanam of that so
		  01:09:44.799 let us take a few minutes to actually
		  01:09:47.120 sit down and process and imagine for
		  01:09:49.679 ourselves so if you're comfortable I
		  01:09:51.198 invite you to close your eyes for this

		  01:16:17.120 the three worlds all the dvatas were in
		  01:16:21.520 great rapture listening to the sound of
		  01:16:24.239 that laugh because it meant safety and
		  01:16:26.960 protection for them but all the raas
		  01:16:29.840 heard that laugh and wondered is death
		  01:16:33.440 coming in a female laugh for us now look
		  01:16:37.040 at this soropam that you see the
		  01:16:39.280 sarupopam that emerged in your dhanam
		  01:16:41.520 even if you had an inkling of it even if
		  01:16:43.920 it briefly emerged know that it is not
		  01:16:46.960 your imagination it is that joti
		  01:16:50.159 swarupini that came into your
		  01:16:53.159 consciousness and as she did the
		  01:16:56.400 swarupam that she had the dvatas were
		  01:16:58.560 looking at and they were so amazed
		  01:17:01.760 because this goddess did not come now
		  01:17:04.800 this goddess is eternal she took a form
		  01:17:07.040 now she took a form from their
		  01:17:08.719 collective swarupams and all the
		  01:17:10.880 aayudhas that they had they went and
		  01:17:13.040 placed an identical of that into her
		  01:17:15.280 hand which is symbolic of saying amma
		  01:17:18.000 you are the shy inside our body you are
		  01:17:20.480 the shy in our aayodhham now we are
		  01:17:22.719 offering that shy back to you this ishap
		  01:17:25.440 puja in its truest sense if you
		  01:17:27.280 understand this you'll understand why we
		  01:17:29.040 do ayuda puja during dashra we are
		  01:17:31.040 recognizing what is that dvy which is
		  01:17:33.280 working in this ayudam in a car it is
		  01:17:35.520 the ability to go on the road in a
		  01:17:37.600 vessel it is the ability to hold
		  01:17:39.040 whatever you pour into it in a book it
		  01:17:41.280 is the ability to hold knowledge in an
		  01:17:43.199 instrument it is the ability to generate
		  01:17:44.960 music or sound all of that that shy
		  01:17:48.080 which is pervading the cosmos which is
		  01:17:50.239 in everything that shy has now come in
		  01:17:53.199 front of me all I have to do is
		  01:17:55.040 namaskaram and offer it offer that shy
		  01:17:57.679 back to adishaki this is adishaki avatar
		  01:18:01.920 and as Adishaki came look at this moment
		  01:18:04.880 she is the one that is ruling the cosmos
		  01:18:07.120 so in samskritam she is called as
		  01:18:09.560 ishwari and as she does that she is
		  01:18:12.960 glowing i said is an agni bunjam she is
		  01:18:15.760 a beam of light agni has a beautiful
		  01:18:19.520 luxanum to it when agni is burning you
		  01:18:22.000 don't need to put a torch onto
		  01:18:24.280 a please glow agni's nature is swam
		  01:18:28.760 praasham just like the word swabha
		  01:18:32.000 that idea that it glows by itself self
		  01:18:35.960 luminous paramatma is that paramatma
		  01:18:39.199 does not need surya chandra agni or a
		  01:18:41.679 torch he glows by himself in this case
		  01:18:44.560 paramatma swarupini is glowing by
		  01:18:46.800 herself and that swarupini as she is
		  01:18:49.920 glowing she is called as dvi dvi means
		  01:18:53.600 swam praash swarupini dwam is the
		  01:18:57.120 pulling the male version of the same
		  01:18:59.920 thing this goddess is present in each
		  01:19:03.679 one of them in Agni she is present as
		  01:19:06.000 the ability to burn in Vishnu she is
		  01:19:08.880 present as the ability to sustain and to
		  01:19:11.760 kill in Shiva she is present as the
		  01:19:14.800 ability to dissolve in Vuna she is
		  01:19:17.920 present as the ability for him to take
		  01:19:20.960 things into his waters any dvata every
		  01:19:24.239 dwata that is present she is their shy
		  01:19:28.080 this swarup collectively shy how do you
		  01:19:31.440 recognize somebody's shy based on what
		  01:19:33.520 they have what they have is their
		  01:19:35.560 lakshara you recognize a musician based
		  01:19:38.880 on their characteristic their ability to
		  01:19:40.960 sing their ability to sing is called as
		  01:19:43.120 their
		  01:19:43.880 lakshara the source of that is called as
		  01:19:46.560 Lakshmi so this goddess this Lakshmi is
		  01:19:51.280 so extraordinary that as she steps out
		  01:19:54.880 now she's sitting there on the lion in
		  01:19:57.440 that swarupam and she's extremely
		  01:20:00.640 powerful that rupam is so powerful if it
		  01:20:02.960 entered your dhanam you'll know this now
		  01:20:04.880 that that rupam to even contemplate or
		  01:20:07.440 visualize that is an extraordinary rupam
		  01:20:10.560 it is worship worthy it is puja it is
		  01:20:13.960 puja thinking of that if you sat here
		  01:20:16.880 and thought about that swarup it is
		  01:20:19.440 capable of removing issues that we are
		  01:20:22.080 going through in life it is because
		  01:20:24.080 she's capable of she can remove those
		  01:20:27.600 kind of pakas that swarup
		  01:20:31.080 herself deluded the world let's let's
		  01:20:33.679 not forget episode number one she
		  01:20:35.679 deluded the world as maya because she's
		  01:20:38.960 the greatest shy and that shy herself is
		  01:20:43.120 extremely untouched by all of this she
		  01:20:45.600 is sat up she has extreme intelligence
		  01:20:49.760 she has great buddhi she has great shy
		  01:20:53.440 she is the goddess that controls the
		  01:20:56.159 mind of controlled beings what I took
		  01:20:59.040 this long to describe no actually are
		  01:21:01.760 all reading this every day mahwari
		  01:21:05.120 Mahadevi
		  01:21:07.159 Mahakmir Mahupa Mahuja
		  01:21:11.000 Mahakani Mahaya Mahwa Mahak Maharati
		  01:21:16.000 Mahabha Maheshwara Mahya Mahabala
		  01:21:19.920 Mahabhar Mahidd
		  01:21:23.800 Mahogari what is
		  01:21:27.080 this we are discussing
		  01:21:30.120 Chundi what can I do when she's sitting
		  01:21:32.400 here that only will come
		  01:21:34.400 this is the idea when you're reading
		  01:21:36.719 read with that bhavam when you're
		  01:21:38.080 reading the words maha this is why I
		  01:21:39.520 gave you such a prelude to the word maha
		  01:21:41.520 when you think of the word maha don't
		  01:21:43.040 think of great it is an incomparable
		  01:21:45.280 great so they said maharupa mahapuja
		  01:21:47.199 mahapatakanashi mahamaya maha satwa you
		  01:21:49.760 can read it with that feeling of
		  01:21:51.280 greatness that oh my god they're
		  01:21:53.040 describing something which is
		  01:21:56.760 indescribable that which cannot be
		  01:21:58.719 described the closest we can go is
		  01:22:00.560 saying so great so great we we see this
		  01:22:03.199 on a daily basis if we eat something
		  01:22:04.639 that we like we become that
		  01:22:09.880 ecstatic that great here is maha that
		  01:22:13.280 supam came what is the name of the
		  01:22:15.920 sarupam that
		  01:22:19.719 came there was no name they just said
		  01:22:22.960 Davi mahatm the mahatma is here what do
		  01:22:27.120 we know the swarupam to be
		  01:22:30.480 but the swupam that went on from here to
		  01:22:32.159 kill
		  01:22:33.480 Mahijasra what's her
		  01:22:36.600 name
		  01:22:38.520 dura chamundi
		  01:22:41.320 dura but none of those names came here
		  01:22:44.400 the rahasam is here as soon as she
		  01:22:47.679 emerged in this form like I said she
		  01:22:49.760 gave a thunderous roar and atahasam
		  01:22:52.480 atahasam is done when you want to
		  01:22:54.239 ridicule the enemy when somebody is
		  01:22:56.400 shouting at you and you laugh at them
		  01:22:57.679 you see how they'll feel they feel
		  01:22:59.840 ridiculous led and
		  01:23:02.280 embarrassed that is what she did here
		  01:23:04.800 but this sarupam was not given a name
		  01:23:07.040 why because Mahatma is telling you this
		  01:23:09.840 is a swarupam that
		  01:23:12.199 is but she takes a name we all know that
		  01:23:15.800 name that name is
		  01:23:18.280 Da that swarup that comes out from here
		  01:23:21.040 is dura but the beautiful thing about
		  01:23:24.480 this
		  01:23:25.320 name is what she has come to do in the
		  01:23:28.880 previous case she had to leave Vishnu's
		  01:23:31.440 body for Vishnu to kill Madu and Gaitaba
		  01:23:33.840 in this case she had to come directly
		  01:23:36.159 she had to emerge and take a form that
		  01:23:38.320 is because this Swarupam is an
		  01:23:40.320 extraordinary swarup this Swarupam is
		  01:23:43.560 capable to directly come into our lives
		  01:23:47.920 in any form that we may or may not
		  01:23:50.080 recognize and she will remove anything
		  01:23:52.159 that is
		  01:23:53.239 do what can you think of some Sanskrit
		  01:23:55.760 words with the word do
		  01:23:58.360 dta
		  01:24:01.159 da duri durmati dur
		  01:24:04.840 buddhi
		  01:24:07.239 dapnam
		  01:24:08.920 durabha
		  01:24:11.960 durara everything do
		  01:24:14.760 do is many a time used in the context of
		  01:24:18.320 negativity the one who can take all of
		  01:24:21.040 that negativity with one laughter alone
		  01:24:23.360 she is called as
		  01:24:25.000 dura that is what they mean over here
		  01:24:27.280 that is why she came and she took a form
		  01:24:29.199 over here and that swarupam of dura is
		  01:24:33.120 such an extraordinary swarup that in
		  01:24:35.280 another grantam there are 32 names all
		  01:24:40.159 starting with that syllable du because
		  01:24:43.199 this is one that any
		  01:24:47.080 dam any kind of du in our lives she can
		  01:24:51.040 remove and take it away completely that
		  01:24:53.360 is one second this is a bij a bj axara
		  01:24:57.520 is an extremely potent axara an axara
		  01:25:00.639 that is vibrating with paramatma that
		  01:25:03.199 axara is in dura's mantrum axaras and
		  01:25:06.480 mantras bij axaras and mantras cannot be
		  01:25:08.560 discussed on public platforms but the
		  01:25:11.840 bum the the seed version of it is
		  01:25:14.239 present in the name Durka that is why we
		  01:25:16.320 have another beautiful text that gives
		  01:25:18.639 us 32 names of the goddess of this
		  01:25:20.639 goddess Dura all starting with that
		  01:25:22.960 syllable of du thinking of her as dura
		  01:25:26.159 that is why saying the name jayad jay
		  01:25:28.840 jaadur three times will give you
		  01:25:31.280 strength in a moment that you find
		  01:25:33.040 yourself weak this is the power of that
		  01:25:35.840 name i have seen this out of personal
		  01:25:38.000 experience and I say this that it is
		  01:25:40.239 capable of changing what is written for
		  01:25:42.800 you that is how powerful that name is
		  01:25:44.880 that is why there are 32 extraordinary
		  01:25:46.960 names of this goddess that we will
		  01:25:49.280 conclude with and we will take this into
		  01:25:52.159 the question of what does this goddess
		  01:25:54.480 do next for us to understand that we
		  01:25:57.040 need to spend time with the goddess we
		  01:25:59.120 need between today and tomorrow this
		  01:26:00.719 evening between to tomorrow evening this
		  01:26:03.040 time we need that time with this goddess
		  01:26:05.679 we go back on that word and say what is
		  01:26:08.400 da who is da to me in my life and when
		  01:26:12.320 we come back here 24 hours
		  01:26:14.360 later she will emerge fully ready to
		  01:26:17.600 take on that mahishasra so before we
		  01:26:20.000 leave we will spend time visualizing
		  01:26:22.880 that form that came to us what came as
		  01:26:25.760 an anuphav as a brief or a longer
		  01:26:28.480 experience our objective is to hold that
		  01:26:30.960 and the easiest way to hold paramatma is
		  01:26:33.840 through nama nam does not require
		  01:26:36.719 anything you just need to keep saying it
		  01:26:38.719 between today and tomorrow how many ever
		  01:26:40.960 times you say da who don't need to worry
		  01:26:44.159 after I say da do I need to offer sundal
		  01:26:46.000 prasadam after I need do nothing just da
		  01:26:49.040 da da
		  01:26:51.239 dash that's all da will remove dati is
		  01:26:54.960 not just for you nama japam is not
		  01:26:57.440 ordinary we've taken it and we've
		  01:26:59.120 treated it as something which is less
		  01:27:00.719 noam no I'm I'm actually more into
		  01:27:02.880 panishad classes nama japam is not
		  01:27:05.920 anything less than any other spiritual
		  01:27:07.840 practice nama japam is equal and more
		  01:27:11.719 because in this
		  01:27:14.199 yogam and is the most powerful and the
		  01:27:17.679 most easy we don't need anything for it
		  01:27:19.840 all we need is an open heart say the
		  01:27:22.000 words dura multiple times see what
		  01:27:23.840 happens to the body say jay dur jay dura
		  01:27:26.320 you observe this and come and tell me 24
		  01:27:28.480 hours later whether or not when you keep
		  01:27:30.400 saying da your spinal cord will
		  01:27:31.920 straighten there is something in that
		  01:27:33.360 name when you say da a certain power
		  01:27:35.520 enters you when you say chundi nobody
		  01:27:37.360 says chundi everybody says chundi it
		  01:27:40.239 commands attention these are not sounds
		  01:27:43.120 there is a certain power in here and
		  01:27:45.280 that is why these 32 names will leave us
		  01:27:47.840 with a hint of what that power is the
		  01:27:49.920 rest of the sadhana you carry on from
		  01:27:51.840 here till we reassemble tomorrow
		  01:28:01.000 evening

		  01:28:40.760 dura who emerged there in Mahakilasa
		  01:28:44.480 amongst all the
		  01:28:45.960 devatas straight from there came into
		  01:28:48.880 our hearts and our heads today may that
