# STRIDE

STRIDE is an acronym and the categorization of vulnerabilities. It useful in deciding, based on the categorization, the best practices of how to defend or mitigate against current or future problems.

- [Spoofing](docs/cse/cryptography/spoofing/index/): theft of user credentials. Compromise of [Authentication](docs/security/authentication/index/)
- [Tampering](docs/cse/cryptography/tampering/index/): unauthorized data modification. Compromise of [Integrity](docs/cse/cryptography/integrity/index/).
- [Repudiation](docs/cse/cryptography/repudiation/index/): repudiation of activity. Compromise of non-repudiation. (Trying to hide who we are)
- [Information Disclosure](docs/cse/cryptography/information-disclosure/index/): unauthorized access to data. Compromise of [Confidentiality](docs/cse/cryptography/confidentiality/index/).
- [Denial of Service](docs/cse/cryptography/denial-of-service/index/): prevent correct access to data or services. Compromise of [Availability](docs/cse/cryptography/availability/index/).
- [Elevation of Privilege](docs/cse/cryptography/elevation-of-privilege/index/): unauthorized upgrade in privilege. Compromise of authorization.

These [Security Vulnerabilities](docs/security/security-vulnerabilities/index/) effect the core principles of [Cryptography](logseq/bak/cse/cryptography/cryptography/2024-11-29t01_57_40576zdesktop/), the [CIA Triad](logseq/bak/cse/cryptography/cia-triad/2024-11-01t08_11_36610zdesktop/)
