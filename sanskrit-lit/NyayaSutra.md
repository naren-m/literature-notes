# NyayaSutra

Nyaya Sutra states its own purpose right at the beginning: to study and describe the attainment of liberation of the soul from wrong knowledge, faults, and sorrow, through the application of sixteen categories of knowledge. These sixteen categories are:

- Pramana (Epistemological methods/means of right knowledge)
- Prameya (Objects of right knowledge)
- Samsaya (Doubt)
- Prayojana (Purpose)
- Drishtanta (Familiar instances)
- Siddhanta (Established tenets)
- Avayava (Members of an inference)
- Tarka (Reasoning and debate)
- Nirnaya (Ascertainment of results)
- Vada (Discussion)
- Jalpa (Sophistic disputations)
- Vitanda (Petty or unnecessary objections)
- Hetwabhasa (Fallacies)
- Chala (Quibbles)
- Jati (Futile rejoinders)
- Nigrahasthana (Methods of losing an argument)
  
In simpler terms, its purpose is to discuss philosophy to establish rules of reason, logic, epistemology, and metaphysics, to better understand the nature of knowledge. Specifically it extends the earlier Vaisheshika epistemological and metaphysical system. It establishes the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.
