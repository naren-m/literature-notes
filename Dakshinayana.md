###### Dakshinayana:

**Dakshinayana starts on July 16th with long days and thus the days become shorter every day over the next 6 months.** The day light decreases during dakshinayana as we move from summer to winter. Solar energy is at it’s peak at the beginning of dakshinayana. The Sun burns, thus it exhausts our energy, we feel tired and drained. Dakshinayana is the night time of devas, thus more effort is required and we need to strive harder in this period.
