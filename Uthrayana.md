###### Uttarayana :

**Starting from Makara Shankranthi on Jan 14th, theÂ  6 months of Uttarayana are considered auspicious because we travel towards the Sun**. Uttarayana marks the daytime of the Devas. Harvest and spring festivals, marriages and other auspicious occasions are celebrated during Uttarayana.
